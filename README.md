## More to come

This really needs to be filled out

## Getting started with this repo

The repo is designed to use `nvm` and `npm`/`npx` so that nothing is expected to be installed globally.
Additionally, to run the examples you should have Docker installed locally as well.

In the root of the repo:

```sh
$ nvm install
$ npm install
$ npx lerna bootstrap --hoist
```

### Running example site and api

The Example work are the folders inside the [`examples`] directory. To run them:

```sh
# in repo root dir
$ docker-compose up -d
# once db is running
$ cd examples/patois.api
$ npm start
$ cd ../patois.web
$ yarn start
```

## Contributing - REALLY IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS

This project uses `commitizen` and `lerna` + some githooks for `prettier` and `jest` to run.

When you have made some changes and staged them **do not** use `git commit` but instead use:

```sh
$ npx git cz
```

Which will start `commitizen` for you to generate the commit message in the desired conventional changelog format.
