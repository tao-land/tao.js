new way of developing software with a few simple goals (more in the Intro: Motivations & Goals)\n\nUse a simplified language that elicits communication between Engineers and Product Managers\nLeverage that language to build the software\nBuild software with the intent that it will evolve\n\nWhat is tao.js?\nLiterally at the core, @tao.js/core is a simple package to use in any App we build to\ncreate Reactive Apps that espouse the principles outlined in the Reactive Manifesto\nby implementing what's called the TAO in JavaScript.\nThe whole thing is designed around generating 3-Dimensional Events in the form of a tuple\nwith a specific shape that follows the acronym from its namesake (T.A.O.):\nTerm - the thing in the context - conceptually usually a domain entityAction - the operation being performed on the thing in the contextOrient(ation) - the perspective of the interaction with the system at\nthe moment of this operation on this thing  \nThese are affectionately called taoples describing specific tuples with this \nspecific shape and appearing in this order.\nExamples are:\n\n{App,Enter,Admin}\n{User,Track,Portal}\n{Project,Create,Portal}\n{Task,Store,Reporting}\n\nThese Events or Messages are defined in this way to be flexible enough to capture any\nApplication Context that can occur in any App while being closed enough so as not to\nbe infinitely diverse.\nFrom there, we use the TAO export of the package to add our listeners, known as\nhandlers in tao.js, like this:\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core';\n\n// add a handler\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'Kids', a: 'Enter', o: 'Camp' }, (tao, data) => {\n  // handler implements a reaction to the specific AppCon (Event)\n  // - excerpted from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ub7MkK-a0hU\n  alert(`Hi, kids! Welcome to Camp Krusty……I'll see you in a few weeks.\n  Until then I've turned things over to my bestest buddy in the whole wide world,\n  ${data.Camp.director}. I want you to treat ${data.Camp.director} with the same\n  respect you would treat me. Now here's ${data.Camp.director}`);\n});\n\n// set the AppCon passing relevant data\nTAO.setCtx({ t: 'Kids', a: 'Enter', o: 'Camp' }, {\n  Camp: { name: 'Camp Krusty', director: 'Mr. Black' }\n});\n\nSo there you have it.  On the surface it's very simple and easy to use.  Add handlers for\nApplication Contexts (AppCons) in the form of taoples and JavaScript functions with\n2 arguments (the taople as tao and the particular data for this occurrence).  Next we\nset those Application Contexts at the right time in the App to create the reactions.\nWith this simplicity comes a lot of power in the form of creating Apps that are:\n\ndecoupled\nflexible\ndesigned to easily evolve\neasy to integrate\nhorizontally scalable\ncommon Event-driven system across client & server\ncommon Message format for all environments\n\nGive it a try and then read the guide that follows to learn more about all of the various\ncapabilities you get by the way the library was defined.\nThere's more\ntao.js encompasses a full JavaScript library of packages built to implement the TAO in\nJavaScript including making it easy to integrate with other popular JavaScript frameworks\nfor building Apps.\nAll packages are published under the @tao.js namespace and available from the\nmonorepo on Github.\nCurrently there are packages to integrate with:\n\nReact.js - @tao.js/react\nSocket.io - @tao.js/socket.io\nand more to come…\n\nTell me more about this TAO thingy\nThe TAO is a programming paradigm designed around splitting up any System or Application\ninto very granular constituent parts organized to respond to a common message format,\na 3-dimensional tuple (taople) with a very specific set of 3 attributes that\ncan be used to describe any context which can occur within the System or Application\n(known here as Application Context).\nDescribing a System or Application as a Set of taoples has the specific intent of making\nit easy to communicate in non-technical terms what the software should or intends to do.\nOnce the software has been sufficiently decomposed in this way, it is reconstituted thru\ngenerating and passing these messages to functions known as handlers that perform the\nvalue added activities of the program.\nLeveraging the handler as the unit of execution allows the software built to run in\nany execution environment.\nPower of a Common Form of Event & Message\nBy making all events and messages follow a common format, there is no longer any need\nto negotiate particular interfaces between the various layers or parts of a System or\nApplication, thus making it a simplified programming paradigm to accept and encourage\nbest practices in building software.\nThe downstream beauty of this is the meta-data provided by all of these Events is easy\nto siphon off to reporting and any other use for the data without additional effort\nin the generation.\n"},"intro/":{"url":"intro/","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Introduction to tao.js\nWhat is TAO and tao.js\nIt helps to set the stage for what TAO development in tao.js is based on from where you're coming:\n\nClient Side, Event-driven development\nBack end API development\nBack end Messaging development\n\nWhy do I want this\n\nEntropy in Software - all software is heading for entropy\nMotivations & Goals of tao.js - why tao.js and for what purpose\n\nHow do I use this\n\nBasic Terminology - some basic terminology used throughout the text\nBasic Usage Guide - start here to learn the usage\nAdvanced Usage Guide - go here to learn more about what's possible\n\nWhere is this going\n\nDevelopment Roadmap - what's coming\n\n"},"intro/as-events.html":{"url":"intro/as-events.html","title":"Client Side, Event-driven development","keywords":"","body":""},"intro/as-api.html":{"url":"intro/as-api.html","title":"Back end API development","keywords":"","body":""},"intro/as-messaging.html":{"url":"intro/as-messaging.html","title":"Back end Messaging development","keywords":"","body":""},"intro/entropy.html":{"url":"intro/entropy.html","title":"Entropy in Software","keywords":"","body":""},"intro/motivations.html":{"url":"intro/motivations.html","title":"Motivations & Goals of tao.js","keywords":"","body":"Motivations for & Goals of tao.js\nSo why do we need tao.js?  Don't we have libraries and frameworks that do this already?\nThere are several motivations behind creating tao.js that originate from a need to\ndescribe software effectively for technical members (developers, QA, etc.) and non-technical\nmembers (product managers, designers, etc.) of teams alike.\nThis original need led to the creation of the TAO and implemented in tao.js as a way to\nbuild applications and systems which then presented an opportunity to achieve the original inspired intent of communicating a description of software through a simple grammar.\nBrief Origin Story\nVery briefly, what initially started by using a 3-Dimensional Matrix to describe the needs\nof an Application Platform turned into a way to model an Application.  When combined with\nsome other architectural models, this new model or way, aka the TAO, then materialized\ninto a core architecture for writing Applications.\nShort Systems Engineering Theory of the TAO\nWith the realization that the TAO could be used to actually build the software it was being\nused to describe, it became apparent there was a lot of value in a system that could\nbe used to build software which had its design roots stemming from defining the software in\nthe abstract or non-technical way.\nBreaking down the concept of Software Architecture to its basist core, it can be defined as:\n\nthe set of answers to the questions posed by a Software Engineer when it comes time to\nimplement a feature of an Application or System\n\nUsing the TAO as an architecture thus means it's providing these answers when it comes time\nto build an Application and add features to it.\nThis system, to be effective, should be ubiquitous and have the capacity to write\nall code required to implement the desired Application or System.  The ubiquity of JavaScript\nand its unique ability to run in any execution stack (specifically in clients and servers)\nmade it the obvious choice for an initial implementation to both prove the theory of the\nsystem and its benefits.  Additionally, the choice of JavaScript allows leveraging the\nexisting ecosystem to get enough people to try it to validate the proof.\nHence the birth of tao.js.  However, to be truly ubiquitous and provide the most value,\nwe would eventually like to port the TAO to other languages and frameworks, and will\ngraciously accept help in that regard.\nMotivations\nThe origin and theory behind the TAO led to a set of 4 distinct motivations, each with their\nown set of goals:\n\nBuild Apps in a Way that allows them to Evolve effectively\nMake it Easy to build Apps with good Architectural Foundations\nCodify Software Product Descriptions\nEmpower Developers with Flexibility of Technology Choices\n\nWe'll step through each motivation here.\n1. Build Apps in a Way that allows them to Evolve effectively \n\nIt's the desire of all code to become legacy\n- Wise Old Developer\n\nAs developers and product managers, we want to build Applications that have a chance to evolve\nover time.\nPrimary to the TAO is a desire to build Applications in a highly Iterative fashion so that\na core value is easy to create, and the App can evolve effectively in any direction as necessary\nwithout the unnecessary introduction of technical debt.\nThis comes with 2 Primary Goals:\n\nApplications are always composable and decoupled\nBuild Apps like Building on a Platform\nUse a mechanism built-in for Extension Points that can expand over time\nAny App built with the TAO can be injected with New Features during execution\nFeatures unknown at the beginning of the life of an App are added the same as the First\nFeature\n\n\n\n2. Make it Easy to build Apps with good Architectural Foundations \nAfter many decades of building software, our industry has devised different architectural\npatterns that are effective at decoupling implementations while providing scalability and\nperformance.  The Reactive Manifesto describes the\ngoals of such an architecture with a prescription for Reactive Systems.\nUnfortunately, most projects don't begin by utilizing this architectural pattern because the\noverhead of effort required to get started doesn't outweigh the immediate need to\nshow some value for a customer to prove the need for the existence of the App.  And thus\nbegins the never ending cycle of prototypes that become MVPs that morph into businesses\nthat then require some eventual rewrite in order to scale the business.\nUsing the TAO, we want it to be easy to begin building Reactive Systems from the start without\nadditional overhead.  By achieving this we can avoid entirely or greatly reduce the\nintroduction of technical debt without the added cost of time.\nThis creates several Goals for the TAO:\n\nSimplified Adoption of Reactive Message-driven Apps\nBusiness Logic code that can be executed anywhere in the System\nNo distinction enforced by the framework within the code that it executes on client,\nserver, embedded, or in a data pipeline\n\n\nProgram by Contract with a Dynamic Interface Definition Language (IDL)\nApps have Integration built-in\nSystem-wide Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)\nThe Last Architecture you have to adopt with confidence\n\n3. Codify Software Product Descriptions \nThe TAO was born out of a way to describe Software Requirements to Engineers that ensures\nall aspects of the desired system were taken into account when designing the User and\nSystem Interfaces.\nThe most common complaints about Engineering Teams are:\n\nthe app is poorly made and doesn't meet our requirements\nthey're taking too long to build it\n\nThe primary source of these 2 complaints is ineffective descriptions of the desired outcome\nin the form of Software Requirements.\nWe want the TAO to be a primary tool used for describing software as a Simplified\nGrammar to Codify the description of the desired Application in order to:\n\nmake Product Managers better by:\ngiving them a device that is easy to learn\ngetting them closer to the code elements of an App\nidentify gaps in requirements before planning or implementation\nreduce the verbosity required by BDD\n\n\nmake Engineering Teams better by:\nbeing on the same page with Product Managers\ngiving them a device to elicit requirements effectively\ncommunicating relevant implementation decisions better\n\n\n\nThis leads to several Goals:\n\nEngineers, QA & Product Managers have a Shared Grammar making it easy to:\nHave access to all aspects of a feature in planning before execution\nEffectively discuss and debate implementation details during planning\n\n\nProvide a Meta-language for Product Description that embeds itself into the code (Traceability)\nProduct Managers can create Artifacts that generate starting point boilerplate code\nSelf-documenting code\n\n4. Empower Developers with Flexibility of Technology Choices \nFinally, there are a lot of frameworks in the eco-system that are designed to make\nRapid Application Development (RAD) easy to adopt.  Generally these frameworks provide\ntooling support to add and make changes.  But these frameworks have several\nflaws:\n\nLocked into rigid development paradigms unable to evolve with the pace of modern technology\nsystems and patterns\nNot built as Reactive Systems that scale across Micro-service architectures or no discrete\nway to integrate Message-oriented data flows\nDumbing down of data store technologies to the lowest common denominator making the specific\nchoice indistinguishable from the others\nDifficulty to upgrade and support major versions without a responsibility from the maintainers\nbecause it's \"Open Source\" (buyer beware)\nVariance in the mechanism for extension points amongst frameworks tying the implementation\ncode to the framework\n\nThe TAO provides a frameworkless framework approach.  The TAO's programming paradigm could\nitself be considered a framework, but motivation behind the TAO is to support and encourage\nthe ability for developers to choose any technology or other framework they desire to\nimplement their Apps while gaining all of the benefits of using the TAO.\nThe Goals that come from this motivation are:\n\nA Framework that doesn't lock Developers into Technology Choices\nProvide powerful tooling to support and speed development\nFramework that encourages choosing the right tool for the job by enhancing the\ndistinctions between technology choices and allowing them to live side-by-side seamlessly\nFully Configurable or Configuration by Convention, the choice is up to the Developer\n\nFull Goal Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal\n\n\n\n\n1.Motivation: Build Apps in a Way that allows them to Evolve effectively\n\n\n\n1.\nApplications are always composable and decoupled\n\n\n\n2.\nBuild Apps like Building on a Platform\n\n\n2.Motivation: Make it Easy to build Apps with good Architectural Foundations\n\n\n\n1.\nSimplified Adoption of Reactive Message-driven Apps\n\n\n\n2.\nBusiness Logic code that can be executed anywhere in the System\n\n\n\n3.\nProgram by Contract with a Dynamic Interface Definition Language (IDL)\n\n\n\n4.\nApps have Integration built-in\n\n\n\n5.\nSystem-wide Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)\n\n\n\n6.\nThe Last Architecture you have to adopt with confidence\n\n\n3.Motivation: Codify Software Product Descriptions\n\n\n\n1.\nEngineers, QA & Product Managers have a Shared Grammar\n\n\n\n2.\nProvide a Meta-language for Product Description that embeds itself into the code\n\n\n\n3.\nProduct Managers can create Artifacts that generate starting point boilerplate code\n\n\n\n4.\nSelf-documenting code\n\n\n4.Motivation: Empower Developers with Flexibility of Technology Choices\n\n\n\n1.\nA Framework that doesn't lock Developers into Technology Choices\n\n\n\n2.\nProvide powerful tooling to support and speed development\n\n\n\n3.\nFramework that encourages choosing the right tool for the job\n\n\n\n4.\nSupport Fully Configurable and Configuration by Convention\n\n\n\n"},"intro/basic-terms.html":{"url":"intro/basic-terms.html","title":"Basic Terminology","keywords":"","body":"Basic Terminology\nAt its core, an Application is a set of State Machines\nconsisting of various States, Transitions from state to state, and Rules and Logic that\nconstrain the transitions between states.\nAbstract States represented by 3-Dimensional Tuples \ntao.js expresses the Abstract States of an Application to represent distinct Application Contexts\nthrough the use of 3-Dimensional tuples.  These tuples are referred to as taoples because of their\ndistinct structure defined by 3 specific aspects:\nTerm - the thing in the context - conceptually usually a domain entityAction - the operation being performed on the thing in the contextOrient(ation) - the perspective of the interaction with the system at\nthe moment of this operation on this thing  \nTaoples are formally defined in description and in code using distinct Strings for each aspect\nmaking up a member of the Set.An example taople descriptor using set notation would be: {User, Find, Portal}Translating this to code that executes with tao.js you will see it as either:\n\nan Object hash: { t: 'User', a: 'Find', o: 'Portal' }OR\nan Array of strict ordering based on the TAO acronym: ['User', 'Find', 'Portal']\n\nTaoples represent possible states of the application as a context that can be executed\nwithin the application.\nAppCons are Actual States\ntao.js expresses the Actual States of an Application through the use of AppCons, representing\nApplication Contexts through which an Actor transitions while interacting with the Application.\nAppCons differ from taoples in that they can (not required) include associated data for any or all\nof the 3 aspects of the taople.\nThis is most often expressed as an individual or list of Objects that represent the Term for\nthe given Context, but don't limit your thinking to attaching all individual AppCon data to\nTerms alone.  Distinct Actions can also be expressed with the Action's data, e.g. Find could contain either an individual id used to fetch the given Object representing the Term or a set of search criteria to get a list of Objects representing the Term.  The same goes for Orient(ation)s\nwhich it's often helpful to attach authorization, session or other data that distinguishes\nindividual Actual States of a given Orient(ation).\nThe \"State\" of an App is Complex\nThe \"State\" of an Appplication at any point is a complex combination of many varying factors.\nThe TAO captures this by breaking down individual portions of the State into constituent\nApplication Contexts which:\n\nmake it easier to reason about the State of an App\nallow rich interactions as reactions to the transitions of State reflecting the true\nrepresentation of an App explicitly\n\n"},"intro/roadmap.html":{"url":"intro/roadmap.html","title":"Development Roadmap","keywords":"","body":"Development Roadmap\nComing soon…you like that?\n"},"basics/":{"url":"basics/","title":"Basics","keywords":"","body":"Basics of using tao.js\nThe first 4 topics below are the most basic topics required to understand in order to get started\nbuilding apps with tao.js.

The tao arg\nis an Object with the following properties:\n\nt: string - the Term of the taople\na: string - the Action of the taople\no: string - the Orientation of the taople\n\nThese properties not only allow for your handler to know exactly why it was triggered, they are\nuseful for:\n\nhaving the keys to access the data object's child data\nallowing Wilcard Handlers to know which taople triggered the handler to be called\n\ndata: object handler arg\nThe TAO will pass the data used when the AppCon was triggered to all handlers that are registered\nto handle the taople.\ndata will always receive an Object, even if it is empty ({}) so your handler can rely on\nthis and not have to worry about destructuring the data parameter against an undefined or null\narg.\ndata can have 0 - 3 keys defined on it depending on what was passed to the TAO when setting\nthe context to the specific Application Context that triggered the call to your handler.\nEach key in data will be set as the concrete taople available from the tao arg,\ne.g. if the taople is { t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' } then data can contain the\nkeys 'App', 'Enter' and 'Portal' depending on which aspect was provided data when the\nApplication Context was set on the TAO.\ndata will always have this  structure no matter which form is used to pass data\non setting Application Context, including data args to setCtx\nor data args to AppCon constructor.\nThis behavior is specifically by design to allow for multiple ways of setting the data while\nproviding a consistent and reliable API for creating your Handlers.\ndata will be the same reference for all handlers called so take care not to manipulate the\nobject your handler receives, rather make a new object if you want to make changes.\nAdding Handlers for AppCons\nThe TAO provides 3 different types of Handlers which you can see in the Advanced Section.  For learning the Basics here, we will illustrate use with the most widely\nused and easiest to understand Handlers, called Inline Handlers.\nTo add a handler for an AppCon, first make sure you've imported the TAO in the file you intend to\nadd the handler from:\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core';\n\nOR\nconst TAO = require('@tao.js/core');\n\nHandlers are added directly on the TAO by using one of the add[Type]Handler(…) methods and\npassing the following 2 arguments:\n\ntaople: object - the taople your handler cares about\ncan take either short form keys ({ t, a, o }) or\nlong form keys ({ term, action, orient }).\n\n\nhandler: function - function you want to be called when an AppCon matching the given taople is set on the TAO\n\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data.App.title}`);\n});\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data[tao.t]title}`);\n});\n\nHandler Function Return Value\nThe TAO only cares about the Return Value of a Handler in 2 cases which are described in further\ndetail in other sections:\n\nan AppCon as the return value is used for Chaining AppCons\nan truthy or falsey return values from an Intercept Handler\n\nAll other return values are ignored so you can potentially use the same function as a handler\nfor the TAO as well as in other areas of your application.  It's up to you.\nSpecial Note: with Decorators on the Roadmap we may allow automating\nthe setting of return values into an AppCon.\nArrow Functions vs Other Functions\nTo the TAO, the handler is a Function and it doesn't care what form that function came to it\nas.  We used an arrow function above to illustrate a common case, but the following\nare all equivalent and will achieve the same result when it comes to handling AppCons.\nIf this is obvious to you and you needn't bother then skip ahead to Async Function Handlers below.\nArrow Function as const definition\nconst handleAppEnterPortal = (tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data.App.title}`);\n};\n\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n\nFunction declaration\nfunction handleAppEnterPortal(tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data.App.title}`);\n};\n\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n\nInline Anonymous Function declaration\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, function (tao, data) {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data.App.title}`);\n});\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, function (tao, data) {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data.App.title}`);\n});\n\nInline Named Function declaration\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, function handleAppEnterPortal(tao, data) {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data.App.title}`);\n});\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, function handleAppEnterPortal(tao, data) {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data.App.title}`);\n});\n\nFunction as class member\nHere is an example of adding a method from an Object of type MyClass as a handler:\nclass MyClass {\n  constructor(stuff) {\n    doStuff(stuff);\n  }\n\n  handleAppCon(tao, data) {\n    console.log('Handling AppCon for:', tao, 'with:', data);\n  }\n}\n\n// Add Object method as handler\nconst myObject = new MyClass();\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, myObject.handleAppCon);\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, myObject.handleAppCon);\n\nHere is an example of adding a method from an Object of type MyClass that is bound in the\nconstructor so the handler will have access to the this reference for the object:\nclass MyClass {\n  constructor(stuff) {\n    doStuff(stuff);\n    this.handleAppConWithThis = handleAppConWithThis.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  handleAppConWithThis(tao, data) {\n    // b/c of the constructor, handler has access to `this` of Object when called\n    console.log('Handling AppCon for:', tao, 'with:', data);\n    this.doSomething(data);\n  }\n}\n\n// Add Object public method as handler\nconst myObject = new MyClass();\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, myObject.handleAppConWithThis);\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, myObject.handleAppConWithThis);\n\nAn alternate version using the Class Fields Proposal (Stage 3)\nto declare a Public Class Method which is properly bound to the Object instance so it has\naccess to the object's this within the handler:\nclass MyClass {\n  constructor(stuff) {\n    doStuff(stuff);\n  }\n\n  handleAppConWithThis = (tao, data) {\n    // b/c of Public Method syntax (proposal), handler has access to `this` of Object when called\n    console.log('Handling AppCon for:', tao, 'with:', data);\n    this.doSomething(data);\n  }\n}\n\n// Add Object public method as handler\nconst myObject = new MyClass();\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, myObject.handleAppConWithThis);\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, myObject.handleAppConWithThis);\n\nHere is adding a static method from MyClass as a handler:\nclass MyClass {\n  constructor(stuff) {\n    doStuff(stuff);\n  }\n\n  static handleAppConStatic(tao, data) {\n    console.log('Handle everybody bidness for:', tao, 'with:', data);\n  }\n}\n\n// Add Class Static method as handler\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, MyClass.handleAppConStatic);\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, MyClass.handleAppConStatic);\n\nAsync Function Handlers\nBecause a lot of what is done in JavaScript relies on asynchronous operation, the TAO allows\nyou to add async functions or functions that return a Promise\nas handlers for Application Contexts.\nThese will have different behavior depending on the Type of Handler you add, but in the Basic\ncase outlined here (using Inline Handlers), the TAO will\nawait for your handler to fully complete (resolve or reject) before moving onto the next handler.\nThere is no difference in the way the TAO operates between an async function versus a fuction\nthat just returns a Promise.\nHandlers throwing Errors\nIf the handler added to the TAO throws an Error, it will not be caught.  It's suggested\nthat your handlers catch Errors and handle them by setting the Application Context\nto something signaling the Error like using action: 'Fail'.\nRemoving Handlers\nBecause we can add new handlers at any point in the lifecycle of our app, the TAO allows for\ndynamic loading and unloading of handlers in response to any events, namely but not limited\nto Application Contexts or if used with Code Splitting.\nIf you want to remove a handler from the TAO, you will need to keep a reference to it somewhere\nthat is accessible to the code that will remove it from the TAO.\nTo remove a handler, make sure you are removing the handler using the same type that you used\nto add the handler function, using the corollary remove[Type]Handler method to the add[Type]Handler.\nconst handleAppEnterPortal = (tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data.App.title}`);\n};\n\n// add the handler\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n\n…\n// Somwhere else\n\n// remove the handler\nTAO.removeInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n// OR\nTAO.removeInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n\nNamed Function Definitions are hoisted\nso they can be defined inline and referenced elsewhere, e.g.:\n// add the handler\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, function handleAppEnterPortal(tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma! We entered the App ${data.App.title}`);\n});\n…\n// Somwhere in same file\n\n// remove the handler\nTAO.removeInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, handleAppEnterPortal);\n\nMissing Handler\nWhen attempting to remove a handler from the TAO, if either the handler is not registered for the\ntaople you specify or the taople you specify doesn't have any handlers then the request is\nsimply ignored.\nThe Decorators Spec\nIt's expected soon the Decorators Spec will be approved and made part of JavaScript.  With that\ncoming, it makes perfect sense to allow using decorators to wire up handlers for you, so expect\nthis to come in the future roadmap.\nSeveral reasons why it's not implemented already:\n\nJust trying to get this in people's hands to get feedback first - waiting for a decorators\nimplementation would have made it easier to adopt, but also take longer\nReact.js originally had an implementation of Decorators that they had to rip out once the\nnascient spec was not approved to be added to the language.  I made the decision then not\nto implement my React apps using Decorators and it paid off by not having to go back and\nchange my implementation, so it's easier to be patient here.\n\n"},"basics/chaining.html":{"url":"basics/chaining.html","title":"Chaining AppCons","keywords":"","body":"Chaining AppCons\nOne of the principles of the TAO is using fine-grained Application Contexts\nto provide a programming paradigm grounded in Functional Programming.\nHandlers can tell the TAO which Application Context is next after they\ncomplete their execution by returning an AppCon to the caller.\nUsing this mechanism, a System Actor (like a User)'s interaction with\nour app can trigger a single Application Context which then triggers\na multitude of Application Contexts to generate and track the correct\nbehaviors of our application.\nThis design allows us to use fine-grained Application Context definitions\nin order to keep our handlers small and focused on a Single Responsibility,\noffering to allow downstream Application Contexts to react to what the\nhandler has done.\nExample Chain\nBorrowing and reprinting from our earlier Example AppCon Descriptions:\n\n\n\nfrom TAO\nto TAO\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n\n{App,Enter,Portal}\ninitial TAO that sets the App in motion (this can be anything you want)\n\n\n{App,Enter,Portal}\n->{App,View,Portal}\nafter entering, we want to show the App's Portal\n\n\n{App,View,Portal}\n->{Space,Find,Portal}\nvisitng the App's initial Portal View triggers a fetch for the items that should be visible\n\n\n{Space,Find,Portal}\n->{Space,List,Portal}\nwith the items, render the list for the User\n\n\n\nWe see that we want the {App,Enter,Portal} Application Context to\ntrigger the {App,View,Portal} Application Context.\nMust use AppCon Constructor\nThe TAO only reacts to AppCons which are returned from handlers and\nnot any other form of an Application Context or taople.  The TAO will not\ninspect the return value of a handler other than to determine if it is\nof AppCon type.\nThis does allow you to extend the AppCon class if you so desire and\nreturning those will still work.  However, it's better to favor\nComposition over Inheritance so this isn't something you really\nshould consider.\nChaining AppCon in Code\nIn order for our handler to chain to another AppCon, we need to ensure\nwe are importing both the TAO and AppCon constructor where we plan to\ndo it:\nimport TAO, { AppCon } from '@tao.js/core';\n\nOR\nconst TAO, { AppCon } = require('@tao.js/core');\n\nHere is a sample handler that ensures the TAO goes to the\n{App,View,Portal} Application Context when it is finished:\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  const title = data.title;\n  setWindowTitleSomehow(title);\n  return new AppCon('App', 'View', 'Portal', data);\n});\n// OR\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ term: 'App', action: 'Enter', orient: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  const title = data.title;\n  setWindowTitleSomehow(title);\n  return new AppCon('App', 'View', 'Portal', data);\n});\n\nIt's as simple as that, yet this mechanism becomes a very powerful force in\nallowing us to split up our code into fine-grained handlers that only\nfocus and care about one thing, and chain them together to create protocols\nto handle the rich interactivity and business logic of our apps.\n"},"basics/wildcards.html":{"url":"basics/wildcards.html","title":"Wildcard Handlers","keywords":"","body":"Wildcard Handlers\nOne of the principle Motivations behind\nthe TAO is to build Systems and Applications that are fundamentally\ndesigned to Evolve by using the concepts behind\nAspect-Oriented Programming (AOP).\nMost implementations of AOP use something to inject code\nWildcard Handlers allow us to add handlers to the TAO that are called\nwhen any of the Concrete taople aspects match the Application Context\nset on the TAO.\nThis is one feature that sets tao.js apart from any other Event-driven\nmechanisms by allowing a Subscriber (handler) to subscribe to\nEvents (AppCons) of any kind along a specific axis or axes (or none)\nin order to react over a broad spectrum of similar Events.\nWildcard Handlers can choose to focus on a specific Term, Action,\nor Orientation or some subset of those 3 or none at all.\nWildcard vs Concrete\nConcrete taople aspects are specifically named Terms, Actions or\nOrientations.  They are called \"Concrete\" in that they are set and\ndo not change to be something else.\nFor example: in {App,Enter,Portal}, the entire taople is\nconsidered a Concrete Application Context because it specifically\ndefines each aspect of the taople for the Application Context.\nEach specifically defined aspect of the taople is itself a Concrete\nAspect, in this case a Concrete Term, Concrete Action and Concrete\nOrient(ation).\nWildcard taoples are those that leave one or more of the taople\naspects undefined or \"not Concrete.\"\nWhat Wildcard taoples look like\nWildcard taoples can be defined in various different ways, the\nmajority of which is to simply leave the taople property out.\nExample basic Wildcard taoples:\n{ t: 'App', o: 'Portal' } // Action is left Wild\n{ t: 'App' } // Action and Orient are left wild\n{} // All 3 Aspects (Term, Action & Orient) are left wild\n\nYou can also use empty strings ('') or asterisks (*) to\ndefine Wild taople aspects.\nsupport for asterisks (*) is due to that is a generalized\nway to describe Wildcard taoples when describing the software\nto be written using the TAO\nExamples:\n{ t: 'App', a: '', o: 'Portal' } // Action is defined Wild\n{ t: 'App', a: '*', o: '*' } // Action and Orient are defined wild\n{ a: '', o: '*' } // All 3 Aspects are Wild, and the style is mixed\n\nAdding a Wildcard Handler\nAdding a Wildcard Handler to the TAO is the same as adding a Concrete\nHandler to the TAO.\nWildcard Handler for all AppCons on a Term\nconst handleApp = (tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`Look, Ma!

As the first part of understanding the 3 different Types or Modes of handlers,\nit's best to start with Inline Handlers which most closely resemble what you're used to with\ntraditional Event-based handlers.\nInline = Ordered\nInline Handlers operate like standard Event listeners in other areas of JavaScript in that the\nhandlers are expected to be called in the order in which they were registered (added) to the\nTAO for a taople (\"Event\").\nThis expectation is modified when it comes to using Wildcard Handlers\nbecause internally each taople is managing it's own set of handlers.  While all matching\nWildcard Handlers will be called along with all of the Concrete Handlers, they will be called in\nthe order that the taoples themselves were added to the TAO, and the order per taople that each\nhandler was added as this will be the traversal order used by the TAO.\nOrdering of Inline Handler execution is not a guarantee provided by the TAO, and the\nunderlying implementation may change, causing any code written that relies on this explanation\nof ordering to be executed in a different order.\nSuffice to say, it's best not to rely on exact ordering for handlers in the TAO, even Inline\nHandlers, and write them as if they can be called at any point in the Set of Inline Handlers.\nTrying this again…Inline = Ordered?^?^? \n\nSo what is meant by \"Inline = Ordered?\"\nGood question.\n   - exchange with everyone who read the above section\n\nThe reason behind the addition of the other 2 types or modes of handlers is to provide\nspecific guarantees about when handlers will be called and how they will affect our\nSystems and Applications.\nThe meaning behind \"Inline = Ordered\" is that each Inline Handler will complete before the\nnext is called.  In other words, when adding 2 Inline Handlers to the TAO for the same\nApplication Context, whether the taople for both is Concrete, Wildcard or they are added to\na combination of the two, only one Inline Handler will be executed to completion\nbefore the next is called.\nThis guarantee is true for all Inline Handlers even if the handler itself is an async\nfunction or returns a Promise.\nExample of ordering:\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'User', a: 'Find', o: 'Portal' }, async (tao, data) => {\n  console.log('First Inline Handler in, so I will be called first');\n  const users = await findUsersSomehow(data.Find);\n  return new AppCon('User', 'List', 'Portal', users); //  {\n  console.log('If no other total Wildcard handlers have been added, I will run third, after all handlers from the previously added taople');\n});\n\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'User', a: 'Find', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  console.log('I have something else to do for this AppCon, and will run second'); // \nSpecial Note: In all likelihood, our App will register some type of Handler on the total\nWildcard taople ({}) first during bootstrapping of the App, so the above scenario of it being\ncalled 3rd is unlikely and only here for illustrative purposes.\nChaining Inline Handlers\nIf you remember Chaining Handlers from the Basics guide, we can\nreturn an AppCon from our Inline Handler in order to \"chain\" Application Contexts to\nautomatically trigger the next Application Context on the TAO.\nWhen Inline Handlers are chaining (returning AppCons), the TAO will spool up all returned\nAppCons so that all Inline Handlers are completed per the above \nguarantee before it sets the Application Context to the returned AppCons.\nIf more than one Inline Handler returns an AppCon then each AppCon will set the Application\nContext on the TAO in the order in which they were received, mirroring the order in which\nthe Inline Handlers were called.\nChaining = Fanout\nBecause the TAO is designed so that calls to setCtx and setAppCtx do not block the caller,\nin the process of chaining Inline Handlers (either intially or for any single downstream\nAppCon handling), if the TAO receives multiple AppCons, it will not block on each AppCon\nbefore setting the Application Context to a second or more AppCon.\nThis means that registering multiple Inline Handlers to react to an Application Context and then\nreturning AppCons from more than one will operate as a Fan Out operation and not a\nSequential set of setting Application Contexts on the TAO.\nasync Functions as Inline Handlers\nBecause a lot of what is done in JavaScript relies on asynchronous operation, the TAO allows\nyou to add async functions or functions that return a Promise\n(both referred to as async functions) as Inline Handlers for Application Contexts.\nWhen we add an async function as an Inline Handler to the TAO, the TAO will\nawait for our handler to fully complete (resolve or reject) before moving onto the next\nhandler.\nThis ensures that all Inline Handlers operate with the same ordering guarantees\noutlined above regardless of whether the function needs to block on waiting for some other\nresource to complete.\nThere is no difference in the way the TAO operates between an async function versus a fuction\nthat just returns a Promise.\nError Handling\nAs mentioned in the Basics guide about Handlers throwing Errors,\nintial Inline Handlers that throw an Error will bubble the Error (not catch) to the\ncaller that is setting the Application Context on the TAO, e.g.:\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'User', a: 'Find', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  throw new Error('I can\\'t find Users now!');\n});\n\nTAO.setCtx('User', 'Find', 'Portal'); // \nDownstream Errors are Swallowed\nHowever, when an Inline Handler chains by returning an AppCon, the inner call to setting\nthe downstream Application Context using the chained AppCon will swallow any Errors that\nare raised.  This is provided by the TAO to ensure that downstream calls that may be\nunanticipated will not blow up your app, or stated otherwise, the TAO provides a guarantee\nof graceful degradation.\nThis is a specific design choice around a Functional Programming Principle to decouple\nknowledge and responsibility within Apps and Systems built using the TAO.\n"},"advanced/async-handlers.html":{"url":"advanced/async-handlers.html","title":"Async Handlers","keywords":"","body":"Async Handlers\nAsync Handlers provide us with the option of reacting to Application Contexts set on the TAO\nin a \"tangential\" asynchronous execution outside of the normal line.\nGenerally, this is used for creating side effects of the Application Context.\nAsync not async\nIn the TAO, Async Handlers are not async handlers, which are functions added\nto the TAO as handlers for Application Contexts which happen to operate using JavaScript\nPromises.\nDue to not implementing this library sooner (the original inception was before the async keyword\nexisted in C#) as well as not being able to think of a better word to capture its meaning, Async\nHandlers exist to provide a way to react to Application Contexts apart from Inline Handlers, out-of-band from a sequential set of operations.\nOrigins of Async Handlers\nThe original intent was specifically to provide execution on a separate thread when this was\nmore difficult and clumsy to code (in C# and Java), and give control of the main thread back\nto the caller.  Or, exactly what the async keyword itself has come to be for modern languages.\nAlthough the implementation of the TAO (which is now only in JavaScript, a language that is\n\"single-threaded\") has changed based on the changes in languages since its inception, the concept behind Async\nHandlers remains and provides a specific need when modeling Systems and Applications apart\nfrom the implemention details associated with asynchronous calls to network or other resources.\nThe underlying implementation of Async Handlers, while important, may change to get closer to\nthe ideal so you should not rely on how it is implemented now, rather rely on the interface and\nguarantees provided by the TAO's handling of Async Handlers.\nAsync = Out of Band\nThe purpose of Async Handlers is to allow our Systems and Apps to react to Application Contexts\nin a separate execution context apart from the one that set the Application Context on the TAO.\nWe call this out of band execution because the intent is that the main line of execution\nwill continue without regard for the Async Handler or its eventual conclusion.\nFrom an Event-based development perspective, Async Handlers provide a mechanism to fire off\nreactions and not care where they go or what they're doing and get back to the main line\nof execution (mostly captured using Inline Handlers).\nFor it's part, the TAO will execute each Async Handler within its own execution context ensuring\nthat any Inline Handlers are not affected by any Async Handlers.\nWhat makes for using an Async Handler?\nIt's tempting to use Async Handlers when deciding to make calls that would use an async function\n(or Promises).  However, that's not always the designed intent of Async Handlers.\nLet's use an example to illustrate fetching data from an API that needs to be rendered in a UI.\nFrom this example, this would be a sequence better modeled using Inline Handlers due to the\nordered nature of the operations along with Inline Handlers' ability to handle, block and chain\nusing async functions.\nDescribing Async Handlers for our Apps\nBased on the example above, because there's a very sequential ordering of Application Contexts\nto move the App from one State to the next, the handlers are better added to the TAO as\nInline Handlers rather than Async Handlers.\nWe want to use Async Handlers to react to Application Contexts when we need \"Out of Band\"\noperations.\nLet's use an example of bootstrapping our App on the front end when a user first comes to the\nHome Page.  We want to either fetch an existing Session or initialize a new Session, and we\nwant this to happen out of band so it doesn't block the User's experience of getting the Home Page.\nWe'll now add our Session to our previous example Use Case: User Enters the App\nin the Basics Defining Handlers guide:\nUse Case: User Enters the App\nFrom our earlier example, the intial Use Case of a User coming to the App, the AppCons we\ndefined and the handlers that need to perform:\nTAO-Path: Bootstrap Home Page\n\n\n\n#\nchain\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\nmode\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n0\nOpen App\nApp\nEnter\nPortal\n=>\ninitialize App data and prepare the UI\n\n\n1\n\nApp\nEnter\nPortal\n=>/a\nkick off getting User's Session by chaining to Bootstrap User Session\n\n\n2\n=>\nApp\nView\nPortal\n=>\nget the Portal's containing View and render it\n\n\n3\n=>\nSpace\nFind\nPortal\n=>\nfetch all of the Spaces from api\n\n\n4\n=>\nSpace\nList\nPortal\n=>\nshow the Space List View in the Portal\n\n\n\nNotice the duplicated taople ({App,Enter,Portal}) added to the table and new (=>/a ) mode\nsymbol.  The mode symbol is a way to distinguish handling an AppCon asynchronously (=>/)\nvs inline (=>), where the Async Handler can include a reference ( a ) to another TAO-Path\nor chained AppCon.\nIn the above table, we're stating that after the {App,Enter,Portal} AppCon, we want to both\nasynchronously kick off a search for the User's Session (Bootstrap User Sessiona ) and\ninline View the Portal (chained as => {App,View,Portal}).\nBecause Async Handlers create an out of band execution context, we separate the description\ninto a new table below.\nTAO-Path: Bootstrap User Session \n\n\n\n#\nchain\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\nmode\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n0\na:=>\nSession\nFind\nPortal\n=>\nfind the current Session for the Userif the Session isn't found, create a new one 1aif the Session is found, enter it 1b\n\n\n1\n\\1a:=>\nSession\nCreate\nPortal\n=>\ncreate a new Session then enter it 1b\n\n\n2\n\\1b:=>\nSession\nEnter\nPortal\n=>\nset the Session local to the App\n\n\n\nHere we see new chain symbols (\\xx:=>) describing a situation where the App may\nenter different Application Contexts depending on what the result of the previous handler is.\nIn this example, the {Session,Find,Portal} may or may not find a User Session, in which\ncase we want to communicate which AppCon is triggered depending on the outcome.\nThe backslash (\\) preceding the normal chain arrow (=>) denotes that the result will not fall\nthrough to the row below.\nTAO-Path: Refined Bootstrap User Session\nFinding a Session may also lead to fetching a User in order to personalize the App as well\nas fire off Tracking code for the visit.\n\n\n\n#\nchain\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\nmode\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n0\na2:/=>\nSession\nFind\nPortal\n=>\nfind the current Session for the Userif the Session isn't found, create a new one2aif the Session is found, enter it2b\n\n\n1\n\\2a:=>\nSession\nCreate\nPortal\n=>\ncreate a new Session then enter it2b\n\n\n2\n\\2b:=>\nSession\nEnter\nPortal\n=>\nset the Session local to the App\n\n\n3\n\nSession\nEnter\nPortal\n=>/\nupdate analytics tracking with Session data\n\n\n4\n+=>\nUser\nFind\nPortal\n=>/\nfetch the User in the Session from the api\n\n\n\nWhich would then lead to its own TAO-Path for Getting the User which we want out of band\nfrom the Bootstrap User Session TAO-Path.\nAdding Async Handlers to the TAO\nAdding Async Handlers to the TAO is similar to adding Inline Handlers, except we're\ngoing to call the addAsyncHandler method instead:\n// add Async Handler to trigger our out of band search for the User's Session by chaining\nTAO.addAsyncHandler({ t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  return new AppCon('Session', 'Find', 'Portal');\n});\n\n// add Async Handler to fetch a User when a Session is entered\nTAO.addAsyncHandler({ t: 'Session', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  return new AppCon('User', 'Find', 'Portal', {\n    Find: { id: data.Session.userId }\n  });\n});\n\n// update tracking for user in external tracking system\nTAO.addAsyncHandler({ t: 'Session', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  tracking.updateSession(data.Session, data.Portal);\n})\n\nAsync Handlers don't block\nBy their very definition, Async Handlers do not block the setCtx or setAppCtx calls\non the TAO.  The TAO will cycle through all of the handlers in the same order described\nin Inline Handlers Ordering but unlike\nInline Handlers, Async Handlers provide no guarantees around ordering.\nThe non-blocking means that if any of the handlers called within an Async Handler do\nuse a Promise, then another Async Handler execution context can take over execution.\nChaining Async Handlers\nOften, as seen in the examples above, an Async Handler is used to chain to a new\nset of AppCons by simply returning the new AppCon that will kick off the new\nTAO-Path within the new execution context that the TAO provides and do nothing else.\nThis is an effective way of utilizing Async Handlers to create a clear and meaningful\nfork in execution and should not be seen as \"cheating\" or excess verbosity.  The purpose\nbeing served is to provide relevant semantics to the desired logic of our App.\nWhen chaining by returning an AppCon from an Async Handler, the TAO will set\nthe AppCon within the execution context for the Async Handler.  Because each\nindividual Async Handler is executed within its own context, a whole new set of\nhandlers of all types can be executed within this execution context.\nError Handling - All Errors are Swallowed\nAsync Handlers differ from the other types in that because the TAO provides a new\nexecution context for them, to ensure the TAO can guarantee any code cannot\nunintentially blow up the App, the TAO will swallow any Errors thrown\nwithin the Async Handler or any downstream (chained) handlers.\nTAO.addAsyncHandler({ t: 'User', a: 'Find', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  throw new Error('I can\\'t find Users now!');\n});\n\nTAO.setCtx('User', 'Find', 'Portal'); // \n"},"advanced/intercept-handlers.html":{"url":"advanced/intercept-handlers.html","title":"Intercept Handlers","keywords":"","body":"Intercept Handlers\nThe last type of handler are Intercept Handlers.  These provide a similar capability to\nDOM-style Events preventDefault() capability, but bring it everywhere.\nIntercept Handlers are also crucial components for providing Aspect-Oriented Programming\n(AOP) capabilities to our\nprograms utilizing the TAO.\nLike Inline Handlers\nIntercept Handlers behave exactly like Inline Handlers, they are called one-by-one using\nthe same rules for ordering outlined there,\nwith the difference that Intercept Handlers react to the return value of the function\nset as the Intercept Handler.\nThe check against the return value of the Intercept Handler results in the following:\n\nA falsey value means the TAO\nwill continue to the next handler\nA truthy value means\nthe TAO will stop calling any more handlers - effectively intercepting all handlers\nwaiting for the current AppCon and downstream AppCons (chained) and handler calls\non them.\nAn AppCon - is considered truthy so it intercepts like above, plus the TAO\nwill set the context to the returned AppCon like chaining operates with other\ntypes of handlers.\n\nThe First will Intercept\nIf multiple Intercept Handlers are added that would fire for a single Application\nContext, then each will (as stated above) be called sequentially using the rules for\nordering Intercept Handlers.\nThe first handler that returns a truthy\nvalue will halt proceedings and if there were any remaining Intercept Handlers,\nthey will not be called.\nNo Signal Specifically\nThe TAO will not signal to the caller that an Intercept Handler has stopped the\npropogation of AppCons.  If this is something you need for a given Application\nContext, then return an AppCon from the handler function and pass the desired\ninformation within that context.\nDescribing Inline Handlers for our Apps\nUse Case: User Edits Space\nIn our Editing of a Space example, we want to add validation so that we don't\naccept and save data that makes the Space inconsistent with the defined data\nrules.\n\n\n\n#\n\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\n\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n0\nUser hits edit\nSpace\nEdit\nPortal\n=>\nget the Space Edit form and put it in the UI\n\n\n1\nUser hits cancel\nSpace\nEnter\nPortalgo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n2\nUser hits save\nSpace\nUpdate\nPortal\n=>?!a\nis updated Space data valid?!validation errors\n\n\n3\n\nSpace\nUpdate\nPortal\n=>\nsend updated Space data to the api\n\n\n3\n\\a:=>\nSpace\nFail\nPortal\n=>\nrender errors in Edit form\n\n\n4\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nAdmin\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data in primary data store for later retrieval in the Admin\n\n\n5\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nPortal\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data in cache for later retrieval in the Portal\n\n\n6\n=>\nSpace\nEnter\nPortalgo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n\nNotice the duplicated taople ({Space,Update,Portal}) which now has 2 handlers, an Intercept\nHandler denoted by the (=>?!a ) and the Inline Handler (=>) it had before.  The\nIntercept Handler mode symbol is a way to denote that it presents a choice (?) to halt (!)\nfurther progression down the TAO-Path chain (and even to the next handler on the same AppCon) and\nset the direction to a different AppCon ( a ).\nThe logic of the choice being made by the Intercept Handler is detailed in the handler spec.\nThe new AppCon the Intercept Handler sets on the TAO is further down in the table identified\nby the reference anchor a: and surrounded by an interrupted chain trigger (\\{ref}:=>).  This symbol is used to denote that while normally a chain falls through to the next\nrow in the table (=>), this one is outside this flow (\\=>).\nIn the above table, we're stating that when the {Space,Update,Portal} AppCon is set, we want to\nfirst intercept the proceedings and check the validity of the data according some rules and\nconstraints, and if this check fails, divert to a different Application Context.  Otherwise, if\nthe check passes, continue to the next handler on {Space,Update,Portal} (in this case our Inline\nHandler which continues the TAO-Path chain).\nUse Case: Refined User Edits Space\nWe also want to ensure the User who makes the edits has the authorization to\ncomplete the edit of a Space.\n\n\n\n#\ntrigger\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\n\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n0\nUser hits edit\nSpace\nEdit\nPortal\n=>?!b\ncan User edit Space ?!User unauthorized\n\n\n1\n\nSpace\nEdit\nPortal\n=>\nget the Space Edit form and put it in the UI\n\n\n2\nb:User unauthorized\nSpace\nEnter\nPortalgo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n3\nUser hits cancel\nSpace\nEnter\nPortalgo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n4\nUser hits save\nSpace\nUpdate\nPortal\n=>?!c\nis updated Space data valid?!validation errors\n\n\n5\n\nSpace\nUpdate\nPortal\n=>?!b\ncan User edit Space ?!User unauthorized\n\n\n6\n\nSpace\nUpdate\nPortal\n=>\nsend the updated Space data to the api\n\n\n7\n\\c:=>\nSpace\nFail\nPortal\n=>\nrender errors in Edit form\n\n\n8\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nAdmin\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data in primary data store for later retrieval in the Admin\n\n\n9\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nPortal\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data in cache for later retrieval in the Portal\n\n\n10\n=>\nSpace\nEnter\nPortalgo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n\nAdding Intercept Handlers to the TAO\nAdding Intercept Handlers to the TAO is similar to adding Inline and Async Handlers, except we're\ngoing to call the, you guessed it, addInterceptHandler method instead:\n// add Intercept Handler to validate Space data during an Update\nTAO.addInterceptHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Update', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  const validationErrors = isSpaceValid(data.Space, data.Update);\n  if (validationErrors) {\n    return new AppCon('Space', 'Fail', 'Portal', {\n      Space: data.Space,\n      Fail: {\n        on: tao.a,\n        Update: data.Update,\n        Errors: validationErrors\n      }\n    });\n  }\n});\n\nfunction checkUserAuthorizedToUpdateSpace(tao, { Space, Portal }) {\n  if (!isAuthorized(Portal.user, Space)) {\n    return new AppCon('Space', 'Enter', 'Portal', { Space, Portal });\n  }\n}\n\n// add Intercept Handlers to verify the User is authorized to Edit/Update a Space\nTAO.addInterceptHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Edit', o: 'Portal' }, checkUserAuthorizedToUpdateSpace);\nTAO.addInterceptHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Update', o: 'Portal' }, checkUserAuthorizedToUpdateSpace)\n\nChaining Intercept Handlers\nAs mentioned above, any return value from an Intercept Handler will\nhalt a chain, and an AppCon returned from an Intercept Handler will instruct the TAO to\nset thte context to that AppCon.\nBased on this, chaining with Intercept Handlers is very powerful in that it's the only way\nto intercept the proceeedings that gives the ability to signal the App to do something else.\nasync Functions as Intercept Handlers\nJust like with Inline Handlers,\nwe can use async functions or functions that return a\nPromise\n(both referred to as async functions) as an Intercept Handler.\nAlso, just like with Inline Handlers, the TAO will await for our handler to fully complete\n(resolve or reject) before moving onto the next handler.\nThis ensures that each Intercept Handler is called in order before the TAO moves to the\nnext.  This will also have more impact when we learn about the order of handlers.\nError Handling\nAs mentioned in the Basics guide about Handlers throwing Errors,\nintial Intercept Handlers that throw an Error will bubble the Error (not catch) to the\ncaller that is setting the Application Context on the TAO, e.g.:\nTAO.addInterceptHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Edit', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  throw new Error('I can\\'t edit Spaces now! It\\'s too soon.');\n});\n\nTAO.setCtx('Space', 'Edit', 'Portal'); // \nDownstream Errors are Swallowed\nHowever, when an Intercept Handler chains by returning an AppCon, the inner call to setting\nthe downstream Application Context using the chained AppCon will swallow any Errors that\nare raised.  This is provided by the TAO to ensure that downstream calls that may be\nunanticipated will not blow up your app, or stated otherwise, the TAO provides a guarantee\nof graceful degradation.\nThis is a specific design choice around a Functional Programming Principle to decouple\nknowledge and responsibility within Apps and Systems built using the TAO.\n"},"advanced/order-of-handlers.html":{"url":"advanced/order-of-handlers.html","title":"Order of Operations","keywords":"","body":"Order of Operations\nThe TAO gives us 3 ways to handle Application Contexts using Intercept,\nAsync and Inline Handlers.\nThese 3 modes were chosen specifically to provide us with enough power to handle any case\nas well as flexibility to keep our code decoupled.\nNow that we understand what the TAO guarantees about each individual type of handler, to fully\ngrasp how to utilize the 3 to their best, we want to understand the guarantees the TAO provides\nfor how they all work together in the TAO.\nIntercept > Async > Inline\nPut simply, when an Application Context is set on the TAO, it will call all of the registered\nhandlers in the following precedence:\n\nIntercept Handlers - all called before calling…\nAsync Handlers - all called before calling…\nInline Handlers - all called before setting all AppCons chained from Inline Handlers\n\nIn this context \"all called\" translates to all handlers of a given type (Intercept, Async, or\nInline), no matter if the handler was added to a Concrete or Wildcard that matches the\nApplication Context that was set on the TAO.\nIn essence, what the TAO is doing is:\n\nFirst run a special set of handlers (Intercept) that can prevent both other handlers from\nbeing called as well as the execution of downstream TAO-Paths in the form of chaining\nto get the interrupt logic out of the way.  Once the App has made it passed these checks,\nkick off all out-of-band operations before running all of the normal operations used\nto implement the desired effect of setting the Application Context.\n\nIn other words, Intercept Handlers are Inline Handlers with 2 differences, they run\nfirst and they have the power to stop execution.  Inline Handlers cannot prevent any other\nhandlers from being called.  We have our special Inline Handlers as Intercept Handlers run\nfirst in order to provide guards that test the constraints of the App before making a\nstate transition.\nThe Async Handlers are called in the middle (after constraint checks but before regular)\nso that we don't block the desired side effects of our transition by the normal flow\nof execution of the regular (Inline) handlers.\nA further breakdown of the order of precedence (or operations) is that when the TAO is told\nthat our App has entered a specific Application Context, it gives our App code:\n\nfirst, a way to prevent any further activity\nsecond, a way to kick off important operations that we want to occur without blocking\nfinally, a way of executing the specific behavior we want to occur for this Application\nContext\n\nONLY Guaranteed Ordering by the TAO\nThis  represents the ONLY ordering guarantee provided by the TAO.\nThis is very important as it was specifically designed this way.  Ordering amongst handlers\nof the same type (or mode) should not be relied upon as handlers can be added and\nremoved dynamically throughout the course of our Apps executing.\nTo rely on order guarantees in our Apps, we use this stated ordering guarantee from the\nTAO and design/build our Apps to:\n\nuse the 3 different handler types to ensure ordered execution on a single Application\nContext\nuse different Application Contexts with chaining to ensure ordered execution of the\ndesired flow of operations\n\nFurther Uses of Intercept Handlers\nBecause the only way to guarantee a handler will be called first (or in the first group)\nis to add it to the TAO as an Intercept Handler, we will use these often for utility beyond\nsimply constraint checks.\nAn example is logging all Application Contexts set on the TAO during development.  As a\ntool, we can simply add a Wildcard Intercept Handler like this when bootstrapping our\nApp:\nTAO.addInterceptHandler({}, (tao, data) => {\n  console.log(`context set as {${tao.t},${tao.a},${tao.o}} with data:`, data);\n});\n\nBecause this Intercept Handler returns nothing, it won't have any downstream affect\non the execution of other handlers for all Application Contexts apart from the effect\nof logging to the console for each one.\nIn this way, Intercept Handlers provide a dual purpose on the TAO:\n\nProvide checks and guards (main intent)\nAllow injecting guarantee first execution for a handler\n\nInline Handlers are the Bread & Butter\nThat being said, Inline Handlers represent the bulk of what you want to be adding to\nthe TAO.  Most applications can be written with a very linear flow of operations which\nis what Inline Handlers were designed to tackle.\nIf you find yourself relying on Intercept Handlers to guarantee the order of operations,\nfirst ask:\n\nWould it be better to split the Application Context into more than one, and use\nchaining to order the operations?\n\nThis is what chaining was designed to accomplish, and why TAO-based Apps are built\nwith finer granularity of Application Contexts to represent states within an App\nthan what most expect coming from other programming paradigms.\nWhen it comes to Async Handlers, it's recommended to reserve their use to sets of\noperations which you want out of band from the expected flow in order to provide either:\n\na better User experience…or\nbetter performance……on\nan operation that isn't critical to the expected outcome of the specific Application\nContext.\n\n"},"advanced/promise-hook.html":{"url":"advanced/promise-hook.html","title":"Promise Hook","keywords":"","body":"tao.js Promise Hook\ntao.js, as an implementation of the TAO in JavaScript with a goal of being able to\nbe used everywhere.

The Trigram for each handler\nis defined using the term, action and orient props passed to the RenderHandler, and\nthe RenderHandler has a function as a child\nwith the exact same signature as any other TAO handler allowing us to return what we want\nrendered in the DOM tree when the corresponding AppCon has been encountered.\nAll Component handlers from the @tao.js/react package are added to the TAO as Inline Handlers.\nAny ommitted Trigram props (term, action or orient) will be treated as a wildcard\nwhen adding the handler to the TAO just like when adding any normal handler to the TAO.\nAdditionally, you'll notice the action prop used in the RenderHandler for the Form\ncomponent which provides an array of actions.  As a convenience, the RenderHandler (and all\nother Component handlers from the @tao.js/react package) will compute a cartesian product\nof all possible Trigrams from the Trigram prop values provided and add itself as a\nhandler for each of them.\nImproved Control with SwitchHandler\nRenderHandler components behave just like a normal TAO handler reacting to an AppCon but they\ndo not react to other AppCons to which they are not configured to handle.  In React terms, this\ntranslates to adding their children to the render tree once their configured AppCon has been\nencountered in the TAO, but not controlling removal.  This means the SpaceContainer we\ndefined above will progressively show each of our Space components as users interact with\nthe app, but none of these components will disappear.\nTo have the selective rendering behavior we need, we'll convert the SpaceContainer into\nusing a SwitchHandler to ensure only the desired space Components we want displayed are\nrendered and will be removed when the application has moved on from the configured AppCons.\nmodified src/components/space/index.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport TAO, { AppCtx } from '@tao.js/core';\nimport {\n  SwitchHandler,\n  RenderHandler,\n} from '@tao.js/react';\nimport List from './list';\nimport View from './view';\nimport Form from './form';\n\n// chain entering a Space with showing the View\nTAO.addInlineHandler(\n  { t: 'Space', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  (tao, { Space }) => {\n    return new AppCtx('Space', 'View', 'Portal', { Space });\n  }\n);\n\nconst SpaceContainer = props => (\n  {/* surround RenderHandlers with a SwitchHandler */}\n  \n    Spaces\n    \n      {(tao, data) => }\n    \n    \n      {(tao, data) => }\n    \n    \n      {() => You must save for changes to take effect.}\n    \n    \n      {(tao, data) => }\n    \n    \n      {(tao, data) => }\n    \n  \n);\n\nexport default SpaceContainer;\n\nThe SwitchHandler is now providing control over its child RenderHandlers by determining\nbased on the AppCons it sees which should be included in the render tree.\nTo reduce verbosity, the SwitchHandler accepts Trigram props that act as default Trigram\nprops for all child RenderHandlers and will be passed into the child RenderHandlers when\nthey're added to the render tree.  If a Trigram prop is defined by both, the RenderHandler's\nvalue will override the SwitchHandler's value both in determining the Trigram of the TAO\nhandler the SwitchHandler uses and on the RenderHandler component added to the render\ntree.\nThe configuration of surrounding RenderHandlers with a SwitchHandler is to provide\nexclusivity aka selection around which RenderHandlers to display.  It isn't necessary\nfor all RenderHandlers to be surrounded by a SwitchHandler, especially if the children\nof the RenderHandler can control their own display (like we'll see with the ErrorMessage.\nThe SwitchHandler only manages selective rendering for RenderHandler direct children,\nmeaning any descendant RenderHandlers are unaffected by an ancestor SwitchHandler.  It\nalso means the SwitchHandler will render any other children (Components or text) into the\ntree (e.g. the h2 title will always be in the render tree as long as the SpaceContainer\nis in the render tree).\nGetting data from AppCons into Components\nUsing withContext HOC\nThe withContext Higher-Order Component can be used to turn any React Component into a\nTAO handler that will receive data from an AppCon when it is encountered.\nAs a very simple example, say we want to have a welcome message for users of the app.\nsrc/components/shared/Welcome.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { withContext } from '@tao.js/react';\n\nconst Welcome = ({ data }) => (\n  Welcome{data.user ? ', ' + data.user.displayName : ' to Mypos'}!\n);\n\nexport default withContext(\n  { t: 'User', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  (tao, data) => ({ user: data.User }),\n  { user: null }\n)(Welcome);\n\nThe withContext HOC wraps our Welcome component to provide the User data when it\nis encountered during a {User,Enter,Portal} AppCon.\nThe first arg to withContext defines the Trigram that our handler will be looking for.\nThe second arg to withContext is the TAO handler that will be called when the matching\nAppCon is set on the TAO with a variation from a standard TAO handler: you can return a\nvalue that will be used to determine the shape of the data prop that withContext\nwill pass to the Welcome component.\nThe third optional arg to withContext is used to set the default value of the data\nprop before any AppCons are encountered.\nNow our global header or App component can import the default export from src/components/shared/welcome.js\nand embed it in the page within a Provider and it'll just work like any other React Component.\nsrc/App.js with Welcome\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core';\nimport { Provider } from '@tao.js/react';\nimport logo from './logo.svg';\nimport './App.css';\nimport SpaceContainer from './components/space';\nimport Welcome from './components/shared/welcome';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n          \n          \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\nThe withContext HOC has much more flexibility that you can find in the doc page.\nUsing DataHandlers for shared state\nDataHandlers provide a way to wire up TAO handlers into your React Component tree that capture\ndata and make it available to child and decendant components down the hierarchy.\nThe Provider sets up the initial data context as a map, and DataHandlers will modify that map\nwhen they react to their configured AppCons.\nLet's say we want to classify Spaces using a type field so we need a list of types as a\nlookup.  We'll modify our SpaceContainer to capture this list and make it available to it's\nchildren.\nsrc/components/space/index.js with types\nimport React from 'react';\nimport TAO, { AppCtx } from '@tao.js/core';\nimport {\n  SwitchHandler,\n  RenderHandler,\n} from '@tao.js/react';\nimport List from './List';\nimport View from './View';\nimport Form from './Form';\n\n// chain entering a Space with showing the View\nTAO.addInlineHandler(\n  { t: 'Space', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  (tao, { Space }) => {\n    return new AppCtx('Space', 'View', 'Portal', { Space });\n  }\n);\n\n// fetch the SpaceTypes when we enter the App\nTAO.addAsyncHandler(\n  { t: 'App', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  () => new AppCtx('SpaceType', 'Find', 'Portal'),\n);\n\nconst SpaceContainer = props => (\n  {/* Surround our tree with our DataHandler */}\n   data.SpaceTypes}\n  >\n    \n      Spaces\n      \n        {(tao, data) => }\n      \n      \n        {(tao, data) => }\n      \n      \n        {() => You must save for changes to take effect.}\n      \n      {/* Reference the DataHandler's data using the `context` prop */}\n      \n        {/* the context we referenced will augment the handler with args passing the data */}\n        {(tao, data, spaceTypes) => (\n          {/* pass the spaceTypes into the Form via the types prop */}\n          \n        )}\n      \n      \n        {(tao, data) => }\n      \n    \n  \n);\n\nexport default SpaceContainer;\n\nAbove we've added a few changes to our space/index.js and SpaceContainer component without\nhaving to create new components or new files.\nFirst, we add a new Async Handler to fetch the SpaceTypes lookup data when entering the app.\nNext we add a DataHandler component to react to the {SpaceType,List,Portal} AppCon which\nwill be triggered when successfully fetching the SpaceTypes from the backend.  The DataHandler's\nhandler is defined to return just the list of SpaceTypes in the AppCon data, which then sets\nthat value in the data context from the closet ancestor Provider in the component hierarchy using\nthe name prop of the DataHandler (in this case 'spaceTypes').\nWe get access to this data lower down in the hierarchy when we define the context prop on the\nRenderHandler surrounding our space Form (context=\"spaceTypes\").  When we add the context\nprop to the RenderHandler, it finds the data in the data context under the key(s) [multiple\ncontexts may be provided using an Array of context names - see the RenderHandler docs]\nand append that data as args to the handler used as the function as a child\nof the RenderHandler (if multiple contexts are provided, then each is appended as an arg in\nthe order in which they're listed in the prop value).\nFinally, in the function as a child prop of the\nRenderHandler we capture the spaceTypes arg and pass it to the Form component as the value of\nthe types prop.\n"},"client-react/provider.html":{"url":"client-react/provider.html","title":"Provider","keywords":"","body":"@tao.js/react Provider Component\nThe first Component we use as part of the declarative React API to integrate tao.js is the\nProvider component.

This is done by either ommitting the trigram key for the desired wildcard\nor by providing an empty string (\"\") as the prop value.\nAdditionally, as a convenience provided in the @tao.js/react package, using withContext we can\nspecify multiple values for any Trigram key to capture more than one specific AppCon (remember,\na wildcard will match any).

The handler function will be called like all other TAO handlers when an AppCon matching\nthe trigram(s) defined in the first arg to withContext is set on the TAO.\nIt is not possible to use the withContext function to create an HOC for wrapping React\nComponents without providing a function as the second (handler) arg to withContext.  This is\nbecause it doesn't make any sense to define an HOC using withcontext that has no handler.  If the\nhandler arg is not provided, and Error will be thrown.\nHowever, unlike a standard TAO Inline Handler function where all return values that are not an\ninstance of an AppCtx used for chaining are ignored, the HOC created\nusing withContext is using the handler function to set the value used for the data prop on\nthe Component it is wrapping, which provides the following behaviors:\n\nif the return value is not an instance of AppCtx from @tao.js/core, then the value\nwill be shallow merged with the existing value for the data prop on the wrapped Component\nif the return value from the handler function is an instance of AppCtx from @tao.js/core,\nit will be returned to the TAO and used to set the context on the TAO as an AppCon chain\nif there is no return value, the existing value will be used for the data prop on the wrapped\nComponent\n\nLet's dive into usage with these behaviors below.\nUsing the handler to return data\nThe first behavior mentioned above is returning a value that is not an instance of an AppCtx\nfrom @tao.js/core.  This is the primary usage scenario when using withContext so we'll tackle\nit first.\nWhen defining the handler function, whatever value is returned will be shallow merged with the\nexisting data to generate the data prop added to the wrapped Compoonent.  This shallow merging is\nintentional to mimic the behavior of React's Component.setState in order to allow the HOC to modify\nand maintain its state based on varying and different context brought about by multiple AppCons as\nthey are set over time.\nHere's a simple example we've already seen:\nconst UserHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a tao trigram\n  { t: 'User', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  // second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data) => ({ user: data.User }),\n  …\n);\n\nFrom this example, when the {User,Enter,Portal} AppCon is set on the TAO, the HOC handler will\nbe called with that trigram as the tao arg and whatever data has been set with the AppCon.  In\nour handler's case, it's looking for the data.User (from the term) and returning an object with\nthat User data set as the user key.  The wrapped component will receive a data prop with the\nshape:\n{ user: … }\n\nLeveraging the Merging of Data\nSuppose we need our handler to handle more than one AppCon like:\nconst UserHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a tao trigram\n  { t: ['User', 'Role'], a: ['Enter', 'Leave'], o: 'Portal' },\n  // second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data) => {\n    if (tao.a === 'Leave') {\n      return tao.t === 'User' ? { user: undefined } : { role: undefined };\n    }\n    if (tao.t === 'User') {\n      return { user: data.User };\n    }\n    return { role: data.Role };\n  },\n  …\n);\n\nFrom this example, our handler is able to only have to return the portion of the state it\nneeds to change in relation to the AppCon that is being handled.  When the {User,Leave,Portal}\nis set on the TAO, it's resetting the user key in the state as opposed to when the\n{Role,Leave,Portal} has been set, the role key is reset in the state, and so forth.\nWe expect the data prop of the wrapped component to have the shape:\n{\n  user: …,\n  role: …\n}\n\nThird (set) and Fourth (current) args to handler\nThere may be situations, and we'll see one below where we\nwant to set the state for the data prop within the handler function rather than rely on\nthe return value and the shallow merging behavior above.\nFor these cases, the handler function has 2 additional args passed to it when called which differs\nfrom a standard TAO handler:\n\nset is a function that takes a single arg and sets the data prop state to whatever value\nis passed in that arg\ncurrent is the current data prop state\n\nThis allows us to have more flexibility and control with the logic we provide in our handler\nfunction to withContext, specifically:\nset arg\nUsing the set function passed as the third arg to our handler function, we have the ability\nto set the complete state of the data prop for our wrapped component.  Using this we bypass\nthe shallow merging behavior described above which is done as a\nconvenience for the majority of use cases.\nInstead of shallow merging the state like when we return a value from the handler function, using\nthe function from the set arg will set the state of the data prop to the object passed into\nthe set arg function.\nAs an example, we'll create an HOC that manages the roles a user can have within our app:\nconst RolesHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a tao trigram\n  { t: ['User', 'Role'], a: ['Enter', 'Leave'], o: 'Portal' },\n  // second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data, set, current) => {\n    const updatedData = {\n      roles: new Set(current.roles),\n    };\n    if (tao.a === 'Leave') {\n      if (tao.t === 'User') {\n        updatedData.roles.clear();\n      }\n      else {\n        updatedData.roles.delete(data.Role);\n      }\n    }\n    else {\n      if (tao.t === 'Role') {\n        updatedData.role.add(data.Role);\n      }\n    }\n    set(updatedData);\n  },\n  …\n);\n\nFor our RolesHOC we need to keep track of the roles that the user is entering and leaving and\nmake them accessible to wrapped components.  To do this, we are managing the state of roles data\nusing a Set so we can't return an object with a roles key that will be shallow merged with the\nexisting state object.\ncurrent arg\nYou can see in the example above illustrating the use of the set arg that the fourth\narg is the current value of the state of the data prop.  This is passed so that we can make use\nof this value when setting or updating the state.\ncurrent can also be used when returning an object to shallow merge state in circumstances where\nthe existing state can determine the future state of our data prop.\nCalling set prevents shallow merge\nSo that there isn't any confusion or conflicting behavior, if the function in the set arg to\nour handler function is called, this call prevents any shallow merging of returned data from the\nhandler function.\nIf data is returned from the handler function and the function in the set arg was called during\nexecution of the handler function, the data will not be used to shallow merge with the current\nstate of the data prop.\nUsing the handler to chain to another AppCon\nBecause the handler provided to the withContext HOC generating function is to be a TAO handler,\nthe capability to chain to another AppCon works like a standard TAO handler in that if the handler\nfunction passed as the second arg to withContext returns an instance of an AppCtx from the\n@tao.js/core package, then that will be returned to the TAO to chain onto that AppCon by setting\nit in the TAO.\nAdditionally, the shallow merge will not occur in the state of the data prop in the withContext\ncreated HOC.\nModifying state data AND chaining\nBecause it may be desired to both update the state of the data prop passed to the wrapped\ncomponent AND chain to another AppCon by returning an AppCtx, we can use the set (3rd) arg to our\nhandler function to set the state of the data prop and still return an AppCtx.\nExtending our example from above regarding using the set arg function:\nconst RolesHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a tao trigram\n  { t: ['User', 'Role'], a: ['Enter', 'Leave'], o: 'Portal' },\n  // second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data, set, current) => {\n    const updatedData = {\n      roles: new Set(current.roles),\n    };\n    if (tao.a === 'Leave') {\n      if (tao.t === 'User') {\n        updatedData.roles.clear();\n      }\n      else {\n        updatedData.roles.delete(data.Role);\n      }\n    }\n    else {\n      if (tao.t === 'Role') {\n        updatedData.role.add(data.Role);\n      }\n    }\n    set(updatedData);\n    // chain to a new AppCon that is the same as the current AppCon w/ orient=Reporting\n    return new AppCtx(tao.t, tao.a, 'Reporting', data);\n  },\n  …\n);\n\nReturn nothing from the handler\nIn our third behavior, we have returning nothing (undefined or null) from our handler function.\nThe effect this has on our execution is that if nothing is returned, then nothing will happen or\nchange the data prop state.  Additionally, this will not trigger a re-render of our withContext\nHOC because it will not call setState on the wrapping component.\nThis gives us the option within our handler function to determine whether there is a need for a\nre-render or not, and return something to that effect.\nFrom our RolesHOC example above, in the case of an AppCon with trigram {User,Enter,Portal},\nthe handler function doesn't return anything explicitly (essentially undefined is returned) and\ndoes not call the function from the set (3rd) arg to the handler function, so it will not trigger\na re-render of the component or its children.\nSetting the Default Value\nThe third arg to the withContext function is how we set the default value for the state of the\ndata prop before any matching AppCons are set in the TAO.\nThe default arg can be either:\n\nan Object which will be used to initialize default state for the data prop\na Function that returns an Object that when called will be used to initialize the state for\nthe data prop\n\nRepeating our very first example above:\nconst UserHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a tao trigram\n  { t: 'User', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  // second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data) => ({ user: data.User }),\n  // third arg is a default value or function for the data prop\n  { user: null },\n);\n\nIn the above example, our default (3rd) arg to the withContext function is is initializing the\nstate of the data prop to:\n{\n  user: null\n}\n\nIt could just as easily be written using a Function with the exact same result:\nconst UserHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a tao trigram\n  { t: 'User', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  // second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data) => ({ user: data.User }),\n  // third arg is a default value or function for the data prop\n  () => ({ user: null })\n);\n\n"},"client-react/data-handler.html":{"url":"client-react/data-handler.html","title":"DataHandler","keywords":"","body":"@tao.js/react DataHandler Component\nA React Component that will register as a handler for a TAO trigram in order to set data in a\nshared data context from its nearest ancestor Provider.  This data can then be\nconsumed by RenderHandlers using the context prop.\nThe purpose of the DataHandler component is to react to specific AppCons set on the TAO and\nadd data to a shared state that can be leveraged by multiple other Components in the render\nhierarchy.\nimporting\nDataHandler is a named export from the @tao.js/react package.\nimport { DataHandler } from '@tao.js/react';\n\nOR\nconst DataHandler = require('@tao.js/react').DataHandler;\n\nDefining the data context name\nAs we know from Provider, the data context is shared.  Each DataHandler must\ndefine a name key used to distinguish the data it is putting in this shared data context.\nThis name is used by the RenderHandler's context prop\nas a way to find the data the DataHandler is adding to the shared data context and make it\navailable to teh RenederHandler's children via its function as a child.\n\n\nIn the example above, all data manipulated by the DataHandler component will be in the shared\ndata context on the \"user\" key.\nDefining the handler Trigram\nUse the term, action and orient props on the DataHandler to define the Trigram the handler\nis listening for.\n\n\nDefining Multiple Trigrams\nJust like with a standard TAO handler, it's possible to use wildcard definitions for the Trigram\nof our DataHandler.  This is done by either ommitting the Trigram prop for the desired wildcard\nor by providing an empty string (\"\") as the prop value.\nAdditionally, as a convenience provided in the @tao.js/react package, all components can specify\nmultiple values for any Trigram prop to capture more than one specific AppCon (remember, a\nwildcard will match any).  This is done using an Array of values for the prop, e.g.:\n\n\nWhen a Trigram prop on a DataHandler has more than one value, the DataHandler will calculate\nthe cartesian product to determine all of the Trigrams to which the handler should be attached.\nUsing the above example code, that DataHandler would attach a handler to the following Trigrams\non the TAO:\n\n{User,Enter,Portal}\n{User,Leave,Portal}\n{Role,Enter,Portal}\n{Role,Leave,Portal}\n\nDefining the handler Function\nUnlike the RenderHandler, the DataHandler handler is defined using the\nhandler prop.  The handler prop expects a function that has the same signature as a TAO handler,\nplus a few extra args to work for the purpose design of the DataHandler to provide data to\ncomponents below it.\nSince the DataHandler component and the withContext function use the same\nunderlying implementation, for a full description of how the handler function behaves, please\nreview the withContext handler function docs for\nall of the particulars and behaviors.\n   data.User} // \n    …\n  \n\nThe handler prop function will also be called with set and current args\njust like the withContext handler function.\nThere is only a single difference between the DataHandler handler prop and the withContext\nhandler function:\nNot required\nThe handler prop is not required on a DataHandler. Whereas the withContext function will\nthrow an Error if the handler arg is not a Function, the DataHandler component will treat a\nmissing handler prop as the identity function.  In that way, if the handler function is not\ndefined, then whatever data value would be passed to the handler function upon a matching AppCon\nbeing set on the TAO, the same data will be used to set the value of the name key\nin the shared data context as if that data was the return value of the handler function (i.e.\na shallow merge will take place).\nInitializing the state with the default prop\nBefore any AppCons matching the trigram props defined on the DataHandler are set on the TAO,\nwe can initialize the value for the name key in the shared data context using the default\nprop.\n   data.User}\n    default={null} // \n    …\n  \n\nConsuming shared state provided by the DataHandler\nRenderHandlers are the components that consume the data provided by the DataHandler to the\nshared data context.\nPlease take a look at the RenderHandler consuming shared state docs\nfor more about this topic.\nMounting and Unmounting\nThe DataHandler has a particular relationship with the React Component Lifecycle that is\nimportant to understand when using it.\nWhen a DataHandler is mounted, that is when the name key in the shared data context is\ninitialized.\nWhen a DataHandler is unmounted, the name key in the shared data context is removed\nfrom the shared data context.\nname conflicts\nIf 2 different DataHandlers are the descendants of the same Provider and\nalso share the same name prop, then there will be conflicts with that name key in\nthe shared data context.  Specifically, if one of the DataHandlers mounts after the other,\nthen the name key will be initialized by that DataHandler over what previously was set\nby the first DataHandler.\nAdditionally, if one of the DataHandlers gets unmounted when the other is not, then the name\nkey and its value will be removed from the shared data context.\n"},"client-react/orig-api/":{"url":"client-react/orig-api/","title":"Original API","keywords":"","body":"Original Usage with React.js\nThis is a description of the first (\"original\") API for integrating the TAO with React.\nFor a description of the Current API which provides a more React-like declarative approach,\ntake a look here.\nIt's assumed you have read and are familiar with the Basics guide.\nIf not, then please go back and read through that before trying to learn how to use tao.js\nwith React.\nWhile tao.js itself is client-agnostic, we provide packages to make it\nseemlessly work with client UI libraries and frameworks.\nTo start we only have an implementation for React.js.\nUpcoming and asking for volunteers to help with packages to integrate:\n\nVue.js\nAngular.js\nEmber.js\nOther UI frameworks (please help)\n\ntao.js works seamlessly well with React given the philosophy of building\nreactive applications at the heart of building applications with tao.js.\nTo work with React, we make sure to install the @tao.js/react package:\nnpm install --save @tao.js/core @tao.js/react\n\n@tao.js/core is listed as a peerDependency for the react package so you\nmust install that as well or the package won't work.\nThere are 2 items we will import and work with to integrate tao.js within our\nReact UI:\n\nAdapter - a class that turns our React Components into\nHandlers for AppCons\nReactor - a React Component that uses a Adapter to react to\nAppCons in order to render your React Components into the UI\n\nExample\nHere's a simple example of using a Adapter and Reactor to control display of Components\nin the UI.  We'll use the same Example Application\nto illustrate integrating React here.\nExample Directory Structure\nPart of the Application deals with Spaces so it has the following directory:\nsrc/\n+- components/\n   +- Space/\n      - index.js\n      - ErrorMessage.js\n      - Form.js\n      - List.js\n      - View.js\n- App.css\n- App.js\nDefining React Components\nThe Component definitions for ErrorMessage, Form, List and View define basic\nReact Components (both functional and class) and are not aware of nor dependent upon\nthe @tao.js/react package.\nThey are making use of the TAO export from @tao.js/core in\norder to set the Application Context.\nsrc/components/space/List.js\nHere is an example of functional Components:\nimport React from 'react';\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core';\n\nconst SpaceItems = ({ spaces }) =>\n  spaces.map(s => (\n    \n      \n          TAO.setCtx({ t: 'Space', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, { Space: s })\n        }\n      >\n        {s.name}\n      \n    \n  ));\n\nconst SpaceList = ({ Space }) => (\n  \n    Current list of Spaces\n    \n       TAO.setCtx({ t: 'Space', a: 'New', o: 'Portal' })}>\n        New\n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n);\n\nexport default SpaceList;\n\nsrc/components/space/Form.js\nHere is an example full Component for a simple form used to Edit a Space or Create\na new Space.\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core';\n\nclass SpaceForm extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = Object.assign(\n      {\n        name: '',\n        description: ''\n      },\n      props.Space\n    );\n  }\n\n  handleChange = event => {\n    const target = event.target;\n    const val = target.type === 'checkbox' ? target.checked : target.value;\n    const name = target.name;\n    this.setState({\n      [name]: val\n    });\n  };\n\n  handleSubmit = event => {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    const { a, Space:origSpace } = this.props;\n    const updatedSpace = this.state;\n    const isNew = a === 'New';\n    const saveAction = isNew ?

You\ncould say that Adapter and Reactor are the yin & yang ☯ of @tao.js/react (couldn't resist).\nOne of the stark differences to notice however is that the Adapter itself is not a\nComponent, but it does provide it's attached Components to the Reactor.\nAdapting React Components to be Handlers\nThe purpose of the Adapter is to convert our React Components into handlers for the TAO.\nBecause React Components are functions in JavaScript, we can take advantage of this to make this\nadaptation easy.\nThe Adapter will work on any React Component, however we will generally design our\nComponents to take advantage of the props passed to them as adapted from the tao\nand data args passed to handlers by the TAO when an Application Context is set.\nFluent Methods\nThe Adapter provides fluent method chaining for all of the public methods that we use\non the Adapter by returning a reference to the Adapter itself from these methods.  For those\nunfamiliar, fluent method chaining allows us to make a sequence of calls to the Adapter in a\nsingle statement, like:\nadapter\n  .setDefaultCtx({ t: 'Space', o: 'Portal' })\n  .addComponentHandler({ a: 'View' }, View)\n  .addComponentHandler({ a: 'List' }, List);\n\nImporting Adapter\nFirst, before using the Adapter it must be imported along with the TAO which is the argument\npassed to the Adapter's constructor:\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core';\nimport { Adapter } from '@tao.js/react';\n\nOR\nconst TAO = require('@tao.js/core');\nconst { Adapter } = require('@tao.js/react');\n\nUsing a Component as a Handler\nUsing a Component as a handler for an Application Context is easy.\nInstead of calling the regular add[Type]Handler passing a handler function like:\nTAO.addInlineHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n  // do something here\n});\n\nWe create an Adapter and use the addComponentHandler method passing along our React Component\nlike:\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent';\n\nconst adapter = new Adapter(TAO);\nadapter.addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Portal' }, MyComponent);\n\nWhen we do this, the Adapter adds an Inline Handler to the TAO\nthat will be called when the {Space,View,Portal} Application Context is set on the TAO.\nWhen this occurs (the AppCon is set to what we're listening for), the Adapter will make the\nComponent its current component for rendering by the Reactor which is itself a\nComponent that will handle rendering our Component as its child.\ntao and data handler args combined as props\nWhen the adapted handler receives the call from the TAO, it keeps track of the tao and data\nargs passed to it so they can be included as props for our instantiated Component.\nHowever, since props is a single arg passed to the constructor of our Component, they have\nto be combined.  Although technically it's the Reactor that is managing this, it's useful for\nthe explanation here in order to understand how other options to the addComponentHandler and\nother methods on the Adapter will instantiate our Components to help us in designing and\ncreating our Components for use in this way.\nThe tao and data objects are merged to create the props on our Component so that we\nat least end up with the following props passed to our Component:\n\nt: string - the t from the tao taople arg represents the Term\na: string - the a from the tao taople arg represents the Action\no: string - the o from the tao taople arg represents the Orient(ation)\n[term]: any (optional) - the [term] key is the value of t and the value is the\nvalue of the data in the AppCon that is related to the Term (from data arg)\n[action]: any (optional) - the [action] key is the value of a and the value\nis the value of the data in the AppCon that is related to the Action (from data arg)\n[orient]: any (optional) - the [orient] key is the value of o and the value\nis the value of the data in the AppCon that is related to the Orient(ation) (from data arg)\n\nClearing the Component on an AppCon\nSometimes we may want to explicitly clear the Component when an Application Context is set on\nthe TAO.  The Adapter allows us to set a \"Component handler\" for an empty component by passing\nan empty or omitting the second argument to addComponentHandler:\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent';\n\nconst adapter = new Adapter(TAO);\nadapter\n  .addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Portal' }, MyComponent)\n  .addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'List', o: 'Portal' }, null)\n  .addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Edit', o: 'Portal' }); // equivalent to above\n\nTAO.setCtx({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Portal' }, Space); // \nRemoving a ComponentHandler\nJust like you can remove a handler from the TAO, the Adapter allows you to remove a Component\nhandler by using removeComponentHandler.  Because you will generally not add a Component\nhandler with an anonymous inline function, it's likely you will easily have a reference to the\nComponents constructor even if that reference is imported.\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent';\n\nconst adapter = new Adapter(TAO);\nadapter.addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Portal' }, MyComponent);\n…\n// somehwere else\nadapter.removeComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Portal' }, MyComponent);\n\nRemove ALL ComponentHandler call\nAs a convenience, the Adapter allows you to remove all taoples attached to a Component\nhandler by passing an empty first argument to the removeComponentHandler method:\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent';\n\nconst adapter = new Adapter(TAO);\nadapter\n  .addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Portal' }, MyComponent)\n  .addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'View', o: 'Admin' }, MyComponent)\n  .addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'List', o: 'Portal' }, MyComponent)\n  .addComponentHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'List', o: 'Admin' }, MyComponent);\n…\n// somehwere else\nadapter.removeComponentHandler({}, MyComponent); // \nSpecial Note: as an individual Adapter is managing the handler functions added to the TAO,\nthis way of removing handlers is scoped only to the individual Adapter.\nSuccinct ComponentHandlers\nThe Adapter provides 2 mechanisms to reduce the verbosity when working with Component handlers.\nMatrixed taoples\nBecause we may want to use the same Component to handle several different Application Contexts,\nthe Adapter allows the taople values to be Arrays to capture a matrix of taoples to handle\nby our Component.  When using this mechanism, the Adapter will use the ternary Cartesian Product\nof all possibilities and add handlers to the TAO for each.\nimport Form from './Form';\n\nconst adapter = new Adapter(TAO);\nadapter.addComponentHandler({ term: 'Space', action: ['New', 'Edit'], orient: 'Portal' }, Form);\n\nTAO.setCtx({ t: 'Space', a: 'New', o: 'Portal' }); // \nDefault Context\nBecause we will usually use a single Adapter to manage a set of Components for our React App\nin some area of similarity, the Adapter allows setting the default context used by an Adapter\nto avoid repetitive setting of the same aspects when adding or removing Component handlers.\nThere are 2 ways to set the default context:\n\ndefaultCtx setter property\nsetDefaultCtx method which is fluent chainable by returning a reference to the Adapter\nyou've seen this used in the Intro to @tao.js React examples\n\nAdditionally, the Adapter has a getter property defaultCtx which returns a copy of the\nvalue of the default context set by one of the methods above so that it cannot be modified outside\nof the Adapter.\nWhen using the default context, the Adapter will perform an Object.assign on the default\ncontext and the specific taople used in the add or remove call so that taople aspects passed in\nto the specific add or remove invocation will overwrite the default when determining the taople\nthat is of interest.

It's usual to create them together, allowing all of our other Component definitions\nused by the Adapter to be isolated and defined on their own where they can be regular React\nComponents without any knowledge of either the Adapter or Reactor.\nHere's an example of creating and setting up an Adapter and then attaching a Reactor to it:\nimport React from 'react';\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core';\nimport { Adapter, Reactor } from '@tao.js/react';\n// import child components that will be handlers\nimport List from './List';\nimport View from './View';\nimport Form from './Form';\n\nconst spaceAdapter = new Adapter(TAO);\nspaceAdapter\n  .setDefaultCtx({ term: 'Space', orient: 'Portal' })\n  .addComponentHandler({ action: 'List' }, List)\n  .addComponentHandler({ action: 'View' }, View)\n  .addComponentHandler({ action: ['New', 'Edit'] }, Form);\n\nconst SpaceContainer = () => (\n  \n    \n  \n);\n\nexport default SpaceContainer;\n\nadapter is required\nThe adapter prop on the Reactor component is required and must be of type Adapter.\nIt's possible to make an interface out of this and allow more flexiblity but we don't see the point\nright now.\nMore details\nWhen a Reactor is created, it first registers itself with the adapter defined in it's props to\nbe notified when the Adapter's adapted handlers have been called by the TAO so that the Reactor\ncan trigger React to render itself, specifically its child Component.\nThe child Component of a Reactor is the component that is currently set for the Adapter.  This\nis why we won't have a single global Adapter like we do for the TAO, rather each Adapter is\nacting as a publisher for any Reactors that care to subscribe for components.\nadapter is a prop\nBecause adapter is a prop to the Reactor, it is possible to change the adapter on the fly.\nAlthough the Reactor is written to be simple, it's not so dumb as we make it.  If you do change\nthe adapter prop, it will check to see if it is different before unregistering from the previous\nand registering with the new Adapters for updates.\nAdditionally, when the Reactor is unmounted, it will unregister itself so as not to receive\nmore updates from the Adapter, allowing it to be garbage collected having no references leaking.\nchildren are ignored\nThe Reactor is designed to render child Components based on what Application Contexts are set\non the TAO via the Adapter to which it is attached.  Currently, any child Components of a\nReactor will be ignored and not rendered as part of the UI.\nexport function MyContainer() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n        {/* everything below is ignored */}\n        \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nIf it makes sense, this could be revisited in the future.\nAdditional props\nJust like the Adapter's additional props, Reactors can be\ngiven props beyond the required adapter to make it work.\nexport function MyContainer() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nAdapter's additional props are assigned when the Component handler is added, so the props\nbecome default for a particular Component when a particular AppCon is set on the TAO.\nThis differs from Reactor additional props in that whatever is set on the Reactor Component\nas props will be passed down to the instantiated child Component.\nThink of Reactor additional props as global to the possible children of the Reactor.\nIf there is conflict and a prop is defined for both a Reactor and Adapter's Component\nhandler, the Component handler's prop coming from the Adapter will take precedence and be used\nto set the value of the prop on the child Component.\nSpecial Note: because these additional props are set on the Reactor and not the\nAdapter and that Reactors attach themselves to their adapters, the Adapter has no knowledge\nand never sees the additional props coming from a Reactor.\n"},"server-side/":{"url":"server-side/","title":"Using Server-side","keywords":"","body":"Using tao.js Server-side\nOne of the goals of tao.js is a unified programming paradigm across all execution environments.\nWhile you can utilize the library easily in your server-side applications, use these packages\nto make the implementation seamless and easy:\n\nSocket.io - easily integrate tao.js with Socket.io on\nClient & Server for seamless tao.js programming across an entire application\nKoa Middleware - coming soon\nConnect/Express Middlware - coming soon\n\n"},"server-side/socket-io.html":{"url":"server-side/socket-io.html","title":"Socket.io","keywords":"","body":"tao.js for Socket.io\nIt's assumed you have read and are familiar with the Basics guide.\nIf not, then please go back and read through that before trying to learn how to use tao.js\nwith React.\nSocket.io is the recommended way to make our server-side code run with the TAO because of their\nmutual affinity.  Socket.io espouses an Event-driven paradigm that spans server and client as\nopposed to the Request-Reply paradigm of traditional HTTP servers.\ntao.js offers the @tao.js/socket.io package making it seemless to use Socket.io to bridge the TAO\nacross Client and Server.\nTo install @tao.js/socket.io, use:\nnpm install --save @tao.js/core socket.io @tao.js/socket.io\n\nOR\nyarn add @tao.js/core socket.io @tao.js/socket.io\n\n@tao.js/core is (like in all other tao.js packages) a peerDependency required to make @tao.js/socket.io work.\nSocket.io is a peerDependency rather than a direct dependency of @tao.js/socket.io to keep the\nsize of the package small when it's used on the client.\nImporting\n@tao.js/socket.io is designed to be imported on both the client and server the export of a single\ndefault function.  We must also use it to wire up the TAO so that should be imported as well:\nimport TAO from '@tao.js/core':\nimport taoSocketIO from '@tao.js/socket.io';\n\nOR\nconst TAO = require('@tao.js/core');\nconst taoSocketIO = require('@tao.js/socket.io');\n\nSetting it up Server-Side\n@tao.js/socket.io exports a single function as the default which is used on both the server and\nclient to wire up the TAO to Socket.io called wireTaoJsToSocketIO (it helps to be explicit )\nTo wire it up on the server, we must get a reference to an instantiated Server that we get\nfrom calling Socket.io's IO(…) default function or the new Server constructor.  If you're\nunfamiliar with this, please check out the tutorials at Socket.io\nto learn how this works.  We then pass the Socket.io Server and the TAO to the wiring function\nwhich will return a TAO Kernel (separated TAO) that will be mirroring all of the Application\nContexts of the client.\nConnecting the TAO on the Server\nOn the server we need to import the default from the socket.io package along with our imports\nabove:\nimport IO from 'socket.io';\n\nOR\nconst IO = require('socket.io');\n\nDepending on how we set up our server to run and what server-side framework we use for serving\nNode.js Apps, we can then:\nconst io = IO();\ntaoSocketIO(TAO, io, {\n  onConnect: (clientTAO) => {\n    // add handlers for individual client\n    …\n    // optionally return cleanup function on disconnect\n    return () => {\n      // clean up resources when socket is disconnected\n      …\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nOR\nconst server = http.createServer(…); // http or https packages shipped with Node.js\nconst io = IO(server);\ntaoSocketIO(TAO, io, {\n  onConnect: (clientTAO) => {\n    // add handlers for individual client\n    …\n    // optionally return cleanup function on disconnect\n    return () => {\n      // clean up resources when socket is disconnected\n      …\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nWhat's going on above is that the wireTaoJsToSocketIO function is setting a new Namespace\non the Server and adding middleware to it that will proxy Socket.io events to the TAO.\nIn order to keep each client separate from the others, the wireTaoJsToSocketIO function accepts\nas part of its options in the third argument an onConnect callback that will receive a newly\nconstructed TAO Kernel separate from the default global TAO.  This is important in allowing us to\nhandle and chain Application Contexts separately for each client.  Optionally the onConnect\nfunction can itself return a function that will be called when the socket is disconnected in order\nto clean up resources set up within the onConnect function.\nThe global TAO passed into the wireTaoJsToSocketIO function will also have Application Contexts\nproxied to it from the client, and we can use these to react to them in a global way on the Server.\nAt this point we then have everything wired up for our server to leverage the TAO and react to\nApplication Contexts that originate across both execution environments.\nSetting it up Client-side\nFor wiring up the client, we use the same wireTaoJsToSocketIO function exported from\n@tao.js/socket.io that we do on the server.\nJust like on the Server we pass the TAO as the first argument, but unlike on the Server we do not\npass the Socket.io Server in the second argument, rather we pass the Socket.io Client\nthat is available as the global io on the client window.\nConnecting the TAO on the Client\nFirst, we must include the Socket.io Client scripts in our client App by either using the path\nserved by our Socket.io Server or a CDN hosted script:\n\n\nOR\n\n\nThen, we wire up our Socket.io Client to the TAO in our client App:\nconst socket = taoSocketIO(TAO, window.io);\nif (socket) {\n  console.log('connected on socket');\n}\n\nWhat's going on above is that the wireTaoJsToSocketIO function is using window.io to connect\nto the Namespace created for the TAO messages on our back end Socket.io Server.  Once it has\nthe socket, it proxies Application Contexts to and from the TAO to and from the socket in a\nway that ensures those that originate on the client do not mirror and reverberate back for an\ninfinite loop.\nWhy using a Namespace?\nWhile it's beneficial to make the TAO the way (paradigm) to build an App, it's not going to\nforce anyone not to use anything else.  Although Socket.io is the best way to integrate the TAO\nacross server & client, the sockets created can also be used for other things if desired, so it's\neasiest to give the TAO its own space within the socket to operate so it doesn't interfere with\nwhatever else is going on, and more importantly isn't interfered with.\nOptions to wireTaoJsToSocketIO\nThe third argument to wireTaoJsToSocketIO is an opts (options) object that can be used to\ncustomize the behavior of our Sockets used to bridge the TAO across client & server.  Not each\none is relevant to both server and client, so the distinction will be made for each.\nThese options are:\n\nnamespace: string or ns: string - override the default namespace used when connecting\nsockets for the TAO.this must be the same for both server and client in order to work\nonConnect: function (server only) - callback used to get a reference to a TAO Kernel created\nfor each client that connects.  Ignored on the client.\nthis is important to ensure handlers for Application Contexts are not shared across all clients\nconnected to our server for all Application Contexts\nreturn: function (optional) - optionally the function passed in as the onConnect option\ncan return a function that will be called when the socket is disconnected (there is a\n'disconnect' event)\ndepending on your use case, this is not required.  If onConnect is not included, then a separate TAO Kernel is not created for each client\n\n\nhost: string (client only) - by default, Socket.io will connect to the same server that served\nthe client App that is executing in the browser (using the page's origin url).  host allows us\nto connect to a different back-end server.  When doing this, you will need to ensure you've\nenabled CORS on your back-end server.  Ignored on server.\n\nMore about onConnect\nFirst, when integrating with Socket.io, using the onConnect option to get an individual TAO\nper connection (socket) isn't required.  If our App doesn't do anything that is particular to a\nUser's session in the App, and All AppCons are Global then this is unnecessary.\nWith that statement out of the way, this is HIGHLY UNLIKELY when building our App, so it's\nimportant to understand why this provided.\nLet's use an example to illustrate: from the examples in the Basics of Defining Handlers:\nUse Case: User Edits Space\nA TAO-Path that represents when a user edits the details of a Space:\n\n\n\n#\n\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\n\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n0\nUser hits edit\nSpace\nEdit\nPortal\n=>\nget the Space Edit form and put it in the UI\n\n\n1\nUser hits cancel\nSpace\nEnter\nPortal\n=>\ngo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n2\nUser hits save\nSpace\nUpdate\nPortal\n=>\nget the updated Space data and send it to the api\n\n\n3\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nPortal\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data for later retrieval in the Portal\n\n\n4\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nAdmin\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data for later retrieval in the Admin\n\n\n5\n=>\nSpace\nEnter\nPortal\n=>\ngo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n\nTAO-Path without TAO Kernel per Client\nIf we implemented the above using the TAO on the server, we would likely have handlers on the\nserver that are called on the taoples as follows:\n\n\n\n#\n\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\n\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n2\nUser hits save\nSpace\nUpdate\nPortal\n=>\nreceive updated Space data\n\n\n3\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nAdmin\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data for later retrieval in the Admin\n\n\n4\n=>\nSpace\nStore\nPortal\n=>\nstore the updated Space's data for later retrieval in the Portal\n\n\n5\n=>\nSpace\nEnter\nPortal\n=>\ngo back to the User Views Space TAO-Path\n\n\n\nThis is all fine and works well enough on its own, but what happens if there is more than one\nclient attached to the server?\nThe {Space,Update,Portal} will only be set once (what we want), but after both {Space,Store,*}\nApplication Contexts are set, they chain to the {Space,Enter,Portal} Application Context.\nThis would get proxied to all clients and set the Application Context to {Space,Enter,Portal}\nfor all of them.  While this would seem normal to the initiator client, this would be very\nstrange for all other clients.\nUsing a TAO Kernel per Client\nWhen the callback onConnect is called, it is due to the 'connect' event on our Socket.io\nServer.  This can happen any time and for the same Socket.io Client over and over.\nBecause of this, anytime a Socket.io Client disconnects, @tao.js/socket.io will attempt to\nremove the client's specific TAO Kernel.  The onConnect function we provide can also return\na Function that @tao.js/socket.io will use to clean up when the socket disconnects.\nThis interface allows us to prevent memory leaks and calling functions on sockets or TAO Kernels\nthat no longer exist in a simpler model to work with clients that can connect and disconnect at\nany time with no guarantees of reconnecting.\nThus the interface allows us to program our onConnect handler as if it's the first time every time.\nTAO-Path with TAO Kernel per Client\nLet's extend our example from above into code for when we use the onConnect method to implement\nthe desired behavior:\nconst io = IO();\ntaoSocketIO(TAO, io, {\n  onConnect: (clientTAO) => {\n    clientTAO\n      .addInterceptHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Update', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n        // validate user authorization to perform Update on this Space\n      })\n      .addInlineHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Update', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n        // chain to storing the updates in Admin db\n        return new AppCtx('Space', 'Store', 'Admin', data);\n      })\n      .addInlineHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Store', o: 'Admin' }, async (tao, data) => {\n        const { Space, Update } = data;\n        try {\n          const result = await adminDb.spaces.save(Object.assign({}, Space, Update));\n          if (!result || !result.ok) {\n            return new AppCtx('Space', 'Fail', 'Admin', Space, { on: tao.a, Update, error: 'result not ok' });\n          }\n          // success => chain to storing the updates to the Portal db (or cache)\n          return new AppCtx('Space', 'Store', 'Portal', Space, Update, data.Portal);\n        }\n        catch (saveErr) {\n          return new AppCtx('Space', 'Fail', 'Admin', Space, { on: tao.a, Update, error: saveErr });\n        }\n      })\n      .addInlineHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Store', o: 'Portal' }, async (tao, data) => {\n        const { Space, Update, Portal } = data;\n        try {\n          const updatedSpace = Object.assign({}, Space, Update);\n          const result = await portalDb.spaces.save(updatedSpace);\n          if (!result || !result.ok) {\n            return new AppCtx('Space', 'Fail', 'Portal', Space, { on: tao.a, Update, error: 'result not ok' });\n          }\n          // success => chain to sending the user back into the individual Space in the Portal\n          return new AppCtx('Space', 'Enter', 'Portal', updatedSpace, null, data.Portal);\n        }\n        catch (saveErr) {\n          return new AppCtx('Space', 'Fail', 'Portal', Space, { on: tao.a, Update, error: saveErr });\n        }\n      });\n  }\n});\n\nIn the above, we are only handling the TAO-Path on the server for the TAO Kernel that is mirroring\nthe client for us, and no other clients will be affected by the interaction.\nonConnect Return Value\nAs mentioned above several times,\nwe can return a Function from our onConnect function.  This function will be called by\n@tao.js/socket.io on the server when our client Socket disconnects (there is a\n'disconnect' event).\nThe purpose of this function is to give us the opportunity to clean up any resources we are using\nfor the specific client socket connection.\nWe'll see an example of it below when using the global TAO to send AppCons back to the client.\nWhat about global TAO?\nNow that we understand how to implement client-specific handlers for Application Contexts, what is\nthe use of the global TAO on the server?\nFirst, when using @tao.js/socket.io to wire up each socket per client connected to our\nSocket.io Server, beyond creating a TAO Kernel per client (when the onConnect callback option\nis used), the wireTaoJsToSocketIO function is also ensuring all Application Context traffic is\nbeing set on the global TAO.\nThis becomes useful to allow our server to react to Application Contexts in a global fashion.\nFor a simple example, let's say we want to keep a simple counter for how many current users are\nviewing each individual Space.  We might define our AppCons and handlers as:\n\n\n\n#\n\nTerm\nAction\nOrient\n\nhandler spec\n\n\n\n\n0\nUser selects Space\nSpace\nEnter\nPortal\n=>\nAC signaling actor is entering an individual Space\n\n\n1\n\nSpace\nEnter\nPortal\n=>/a\ntrack entrances to Spaces\n\n\n2\n=>\nSpace\nView\nPortal\n=>\nget the Space View and put it in the UI\n\n\n3\n=>\nSpace-Phrase\nFind\nPortal\n=>\nfetch all of the Space-Phrase relations from the api\n\n\n4\n=>\nSpace-Phrase\nList\nPortal\n=>\nshow the list of Phrases for a Space in the UI\n\n\n5\n\\a=>\nSpace\nEnter\nTrack\n=>\nincrement entrance count for Space\n\n\n\nAnd we would implement this (abbreviated) as:\n// on the CLIENT\nTAO\n  .addInlineHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n    return new AppCtx('Space', 'View', 'Portal', data);\n  })\n  …\n\n// on the SERVER\nTAO\n  .addAsyncHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n    return new AppCtx('Space', 'Enter', 'Track', data);\n  })\n  .addInlineHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Enter', o: 'Track' }, (tao, data) => {\n    const { Space } = data;\n    if (!spaceCounters[Space.id]) {\n      spaceCounters[Space.id] = 0;\n    }\n    spaceCounters[Space.id]++;\n  });\n\nThis means our client never worries about the tracking code or even the chain to it and our server\ncan react to the {Space,Enter,Portal} in a way that is meaningful to the server, first by\nasynchronously chaining to {Space,Enter,Track} and then using that Application Context to then\nupdate the counter.\nOptionally, the counter increment could have simply been within the server-side Async Handler on\n{Space,Enter,Portal}, but we took the opportunity to illustrate an alternative Orient(ation)\nwe might use for our Application Contexts.\nSending back updated counts\nNow, we can use this to feed back to all of our clients the current view count by making a few\nmore changes:\n// on the SERVER\nconst spaceCounters = {};\n\nTAO\n  .addAsyncHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n    return new AppCtx('Space', 'Enter', 'Track', data);\n  })\n  .addInlineHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Enter', o: 'Track' }, (tao, data) => {\n    const { Space } = data;\n    if (!spaceCounters[Space.id]) {\n      spaceCounters[Space.id] = 0;\n    }\n    spaceCounters[Space.id]++;\n    return new AppCtx('Space', 'Tracked', 'Portal', { id: Space.id }, spaceCounters[Space.id]);\n  });\n…\n\nconst io = IO();\ntaoSocketIO(TAO, io, {\n  onConnect: (clientTAO, onDisconnect) => {\n  // keep reference to handler we will need to remove\n  const forwardSpaceTracked = (tao, data) => {\n    clientTAO.setCtx(tao, data);\n  };\n\n  // forward the AppCon to the client\n  TAO.addInlineHandler(\n    { t: 'Space', a: 'Tracked', o: 'Portal' },\n    forwardSpaceTracked\n  );\n\n  // return function used for cleanup when socket is disconnected\n  return () => {\n    console.log('disconnected client - removing TAO handler');\n    // remove the handler so we don't call clientTAO.setCtx after it's been disconnected\n    TAO.removeInlineHandler(\n      { t: 'Space', a: 'Tracked', o: 'Portal' },\n      forwardSpaceTracked\n    );\n  };\n  …\n});\n\n// on the CLIENT\nTAO\n  …\n  .addAsyncHandler({ t: 'Space', a: 'Tracked', o: 'Portal' }, (tao, data) => {\n    const { Space, Tracked } = data;\n    // somehow update a current entered/viewer count on the space if the current Space is in view\n    updateSpaceViewers(Space.id, Tracked); // \nObviously this can be used for much more complex cases than this, but we hope it illustrates the\npoint.  If you have a better example that's as easy to communicate, please submit a PR \nOne that comes to mind is updating all clients viewing a Space when that Space gets an Update\nstored in the database.  This will require a little bit of thought that I don't have right now\n\n"},"server-side/koa.html":{"url":"server-side/koa.html","title":"Koa Middleware","keywords":"","body":""},"server-side/connect.html":{"url":"server-side/connect.html","title":"Connect/Express Middlware","keywords":"","body":""},"router/":{"url":"router/","title":"URL Handling wtih @tao.js/router","keywords":"","body":"URL Handling wtih @tao.js/router\nRouting Philosophy\nThe @tao.js/router starts from philosophy that URL manipulation by a Single Page App (SPA)\nserves the following purposes:\n\nProvides an initial context to the application when a user first navigates to it\nExists as an external serialization/reflection of a current state of the application to make that application context sharable\n\nBecause the URL is generally seen in this  way as both a side-effect of a running\napplication and an initiator to the start of an application, we gain more power and flexibility in\ndealing with the URL as a part of our application by splitting both of these purposes up into 2\ndistinct ways of interacting with the URL.\nWhy split the routing like this\nWith the advent of SPAs, url routing within the application is different.  On a server, if a resource\nis requested that does not exist, according to the HTTP Protocol, the server returns a\n404 NOT FOUND.  However, within an SPA, if a resource does not exist, what should we do?\nIn my opinion the better user experience is not to take the user to a page that doesn't exist, but\nfor the application to react accordingly when a resource requested does not exist.\nFrom that standpoint, the URL in the SPA is the reflection of the current context of the application,\nand the user should only get there in the successful (or \"happy\") path.\nAdd/Remove TAO Trigram to/from Route\nThe first and most used interaction is to configure our Router to react to taoples signaled in the TAO so the URL of our application is updated to reflect the current application context.\nThe API is described below, but the concept is that we are Adding the Route to our app so that\nit will react to a TAO trigram when an Application Context is signaled that matches the trigram.\n@tao.js/router supports and encourages usage of Wildcard trigrams\nso that the term, action or orientation can be serialized into the route itself, meaning we\ncan have fewer actual routes to configure in our app.\nIf modules are loaded dynamically during the execution of the App, Routes can be dynamically\nadded and removed from the router.\nBecause @tao.js espouses the UI to react to Application Contexts signaled in the TAO (using\nlibraries like @tao.js/react), we are not reliant on the URL to tell the App\nwhat UI views or components should be mounted and visible in the App.  What we need then is the\nrouter to reflect what is happening in the App to make it a specific context a user can share\nor rejoin at any point.\nAttach/Detach TAO trigram to/from Route\nThe second interaction relates to triggering an initial context when a user comes to the App for\nthe first time.(We'll discuss browser back & forward later below)\nWhen a user comes to the app, we need to signal to the TAO what application context is set based\non the incoming route of the user to the app.\nTo do this, we use Attach to tell the Router which trigram to use to signal the TAO which\nApplication Context we want triggered based on the incoming route.\nWhy isn't this the same as the TAO Trigram Added to the Route?\nFirst, it can be.  There's nothing in the Router preventing this, and you can pass the attach\noption to the Add call that will signal to the Router to attach the same trigram configuration\nto the Route so you won't have to make 2 explicit calls.\nHowever, the philosophy of building applications with the TAO is to break up your application into\nmore granular Application Contexts (as trigrams) so that we have finer grained handlers that only\nhave one responsibility as well as more points to inject new behaviors down the road.\nWhen building your TAO-based application like this , it's advantageous to split up the\nAdd vs Attach so that the same Route can be used:\n\nas the result of a successful chain of Application Contexts (the trigram Added to the Route)OR\nto initiate the same chain of Application Contexts (the trigram Attached to the Route) to kick off a chain of Application Contexts (via\nAttach) when the user first comes to the app and also be a reaction to an ending Application Context (via Add) once the user is interacting with our app as an SPA signaling ACs as they go.\n\n"},"api/":{"url":"api/","title":"API Reference","keywords":"","body":"API Documentation\nTODO: migrate this to jsdocs\n\n@tao.js/core\nTAO\nKernel\nAppCon\n\n\n@tao.js/react\nProvider\nReactor\n\n\n@tao.js/socket.io\nwireTaoJsToSocketIO\n\n\n\n"},"api/core/":{"url":"api/core/","title":"@tao.js/core","keywords":"","body":"@tao.js/core package API\nThe public API for the @tao.js/core package exposes the following:\n\nTAO - default export\nKernel - named export\nAppCon - named export\n\n"},"api/core/tao.html":{"url":"api/core/tao.html","title":"TAO","keywords":"","body":"TAO API\nPackage: @tao.js/core\nDefault Export\nDescription\nThe default export of the @tao.js/core package, TAO is a Kernel and therefore\nimplements the API provided.\n"},"api/core/kernel.html":{"url":"api/core/kernel.html","title":"Kernel","keywords":"","body":"Kernel API\nPackage: @tao.js/core\nNamed Export: Kernel\nThe Kernel is the base entry point of execution for tao.js apps.

arg to the handler) within the handler function\n\nTo ensure deterministic behavior, if the set function is called, the return value of the handler\nfunction will not be merged with the existing value.\nChaining\nThe handler function of the withContext HOC has the ability as any other hander to chain to\nanother AppCon by returning an AppCon from the function.\nIf an AppCon is returned from the handler function, it will not be merged with the existing\nvalue of the data prop.\nTo chain using an AppCon as well as change the value of the data prop of the wrapped\nComponent, use the set function (3rd arg to handler) before returning the next chained AppCon.\nSpecial Note to avoid unnecessary React renders\nIf neither the handler returns a value nor the set arg to the handler function is called, this\nwill instruct the HOC that no change has occurred as a result of the AppCon being set on the TAO in\nwhich case the HOC will not trigger a render.\nExamples\nBasic Example\nconst UserHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a tao trigram\n  { t: 'User', a: 'Enter', o: 'Portal' },\n  // second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data) => ({ user: data.User }),\n  …\n);\n\nexport

// second arg is a handler function\n  (tao, data) => {\n    if (tao.a === 'Leave') {\n      return tao.t === 'User' ? { user: undefined } : { role: undefined };\n    }\n    if (tao.t === 'User') {\n      return { user: data.User };\n    }\n    return { role: data.Role };\n  },\n  …\n);\n\nexport default UserHOC(UserView);\n\nUsing set function\nconst RolesHOC = withContext(\n  // first arg is a

arg Function that will be called returning an Object used to initialize the name key in the shared data context\n\n\n\nhandler function prop\nThe handler prop expects a function that will receive the following args:\n\ntao - trigram of the AppCon set on the TAO that is what triggered the call to the handler\ndata - data associated with the AppCon when it was set on the TAO\nset - a one arg function that can be used to set the value of the name key in the shared data\ncontext\ncurrent - the current value of the name key in the shared data context\n\nhandler function prop behaviors\nUnlike a standard TAO Inline Handler function where all return values that are not an\ninstance of an AppCtx used for chaining are ignored, the\nDataHandler's handler function is used to set the value of the name key in the shared data\ncontext, and so provides the following behaviors:\n\nif the set function passed to the handler is called, that will completely set (overwriting\nexisting values) the value of the name key in the shared data context to the value passed to\nset\nif the set function is not called and the return value is not an instance of AppCtx\nfrom @tao.js/core, then the value will be shallow merged with the existing value for the name\nkey in the shared data context\nif the return value from the handler function is an instance of AppCtx from @tao.js/core,\nit will be returned to the TAO and used to set the context on the TAO as an AppCon chain\n*this can be used in conjunction with the set function passed to the handler\n\n\nif the set function is not called and the handler does not return a value, then nothing will\nhappen\n\nIf not provided as a prop to a DataHandler, the default will be a handler that receives the TAO\nAppCon (tao, data) [trigram and data] and return the data arg without manipulation, serving the\nsecond behavior outlined above.\nChildren\nChildren are required\nChildren can be any valid child of a React Component (so anything).\nDescendant RenderHandlers can gain access to the data the DataHandler is\nupdating in the shared data context from the Provider by using the DataHandler's\nname key in the context prop of the RenderHandler.\nExample\nA simple example of a DataHandler being used to set the User in the shared data context with a\nuser key:\n data.User} // \n  …\n\n\nMore complex example of a DataHandler being used to the Roles for a User in the shared data\nconstext with a roles key:\n {\n    const updatedData = {\n      roles: new Set(current.roles),\n    };\n    if (tao.a === 'Leave') {\n      if (tao.t === 'User') {\n        updatedData.roles.clear();\n      }\n      else {\n        updatedData.roles.delete(data.Role);\n      }\n    }\n    else {\n      if (tao.t === 'Role') {\n        updatedData.role.add(data.Role);\n      }\n    }\n    set(updatedData);\n  }}\n>\n  {/* consumption by children and descendants */}\n
