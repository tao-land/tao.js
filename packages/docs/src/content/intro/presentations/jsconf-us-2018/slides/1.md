# Describe the TAO

Let's start with a new _way_ of programming called the TAO.

The TAO defines 3 things:

1. A Message Format
2. 3 Ways to handle Messages
3. A centralized mechanism to decouple message generators from message handlers and allow chaining

The TAO is a prescriptive message format using a trigram of 3 words to define a
specific Application Context which could be considered an Application Event

## Message Format

The TAO is partially an acronym for:  
**T**erm - what is the subject of our message?  
**A**ction - what operation is occurring in our message?  
**O**rient(ation) - from what perspective is our message coming?

This description is used to identify a strict message format that can
universally define any context an application can take.

## System of Handlers

The TAO also defines a generalized way of setting the context of an
application through TAO messages, and attach handlers to respond to
those messages.

The TAO defines 3 different types of handlers:

* inline - happening in ordered sequence - desired effects
* async - happening out of band - desired side-effects
* intercept - having the capability of halting execution - guards
