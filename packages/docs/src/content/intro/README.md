# Introduction to `tao.js`

## What is TAO and `tao.js`

It helps to set the stage for _what_ TAO development in `tao.js` is based on from _where_ you're coming:

* [Client Side, Event-driven development](as-events.md)
* [Back end API development](as-api.md)
* [Back end Messaging development](as-messaging.md)

## Why do I want this

* [Decoupling Application from Architecture](decoupling.md) - evolve each independently
* [A Framework for Building a Platform](platform-framework.md) - the best of both worlds
* [Entropy in Software](entropy.md) - all software is heading for entropy
* [Antifragile Software](antifragile.md) - making software that is as antifragile as its product
* [Motivations & Goals of tao.js](motivations.md) - why tao.js and for what purpose

## How do I use this

* [Basic Terminology](basic-terms.md) - some basic terminology used throughout the text
* [Basic Usage Guide](../basics/README.md) - start here to learn the usage
* [Advanced Usage Guide](../advanced/README.md) - go here to learn more about what's possible

## Where is this going

* [Development Roadmap](roadmap.md) - what's coming
